## About the Project

The best thing about my otherwise complicated family is our Jewish practice—my mother made our shabbats and holidays beautiful, full of light and laughter and great food. My Jewish identity and ritual practice used to be a central organizing force in my life, but ever since my relationship with my mother went off the rails, my relationship to my Jewish identity and to Jewish ritual has been off the rails too. 

I was raised to believe that Jewish continuity was the paramount concern of a Jewish life, and that my number one job as a Jewish woman is to pass down Jewish ritual from a chain of ancestral mothers to a chain of future daughters. Now that I have broken the chain within my own family, it's is difficult for me to make sense of what that means about my place in the greater chain of Jewish community and continuity. 

In this project I'd like to reimagine and create a set of jewish ritual objects that would allow me to reclaim a Jewish practice and identity that includes my mother and grandmothers' stories, but is also mine. Put another way, "how might I have a relationship with this beautiful thing (Judaism), which is also a crime scene" (not my words) and do I need that relationship at all? 

I've chosen 3 objects to create/recreate for this project.

1. **Challah cover:** My mom baked challah (enriched bread eaten on the sabbath) most Friday nights of my early childhood. I always wanted her to teach me and include me, and she occasionally did. I've made it on my own a few times. She uses a recipe which is a little more labor intensive than average, but it's always felt like a violation to even consider using a different, easier recipe. It also is really hard for me to make her recipe without getting really sad. As a result, despite my enthusiasm for baking, and bread baking, I haven't made a challah in years. I will bake a challah, and create a challah cover (a ritual textile that covers the challah) that incorporates the recipe. 
2. **Decorative blessing over the home:** My mother does a whole lot of Hebrew calligraphy and illuminations, for things like ketubahs (wedding contracts), invitations, etc. When I moved into my first "grown-up" i.e. non-college apartment, she gave me a blessing over the home she made. It's been hanging over my bed for my entire adult life, despite some obvious changes in how I relate to my mother's influence in my life. I think it would be meaningful for me to rewrite my own blessing over the home, articulating what "shalom bayit" or "peace in the home" means to me, and to turn it into a piece of art which can sit on top of my mom's illumination in the frame. That way I can honor her work but also not have to look at it every day. 
3. **Candlesticks:** Another ritual I can't handle anymore is candle-lighting. The history of candle lighting my my family is extremely deep, and the emotions in it are deep as well. The candlesticks in my family are extremely meaningful to me, not knowing whether my mother will hand them down to me is distressing. As my relationship with my mom has fractured, I've stopped being willing to light shabbat candles. Making candlesticks that can "understudy" for the candlesticks of my childhood would be a way to reclaim the ritual for myself. 

## Artifacts

**Blessing Over the Home**

##### On the left is my mom's art hanging in the frame, and on the right is my piece hanging there placed over it. If you look closely there's the faintest trace of my mom's work showing through. 

To make this, I started with the text of the blessing, and then wrote some words that I felt capture the home I'd like to create. I worked iteratively with a technique called solvent transfer to create a series of images drawn from the tree of life motif in the candlesticks, and which my mother wears on a necklace I made her. Working iteratively I was able to work step by step until I felt like I'd made something I felt good about. I liked being able to incorporate digital and tangible media together.

While I did write a little bit of a blessing, I ended up choosing to "hide" it within the images. These photos show how I progressed from a text based piece, through a single photo, to realizing I wanted to include 3 images: One representing my family's story of migration during WW2, one reflecting the jewish identity and experiences of my childhood, and one reflecting my own independent jewish identity. I arranged the images so that the foundational 2 represent the past, with my present and future growing upwards out of them. 

**A takeaway about making:** Working with a medium that combined digital and tangible was really fun, and I came away feeling like xerox transfer is a technique that would be great to do with young people because you get a lot of visual power with very little skill. 

**A takeaway about the therapy:** I asked a colleague for feedback, and with one question she completely reoriented my relationship to this project, and the aesthetic path to resolving it. This underscored for me that reflection and conversation are absolutely essential to making meaning from making. 

**Candlesticks**

These are the original candlesticks.

For the candlesticks I drew inspiration from a story I was raised on. I have been told that the candlesticks were one of 2 possessions which survived the war. The other was a single diamond, the last of several which had been sewn into the hems of my family's clothes to use as bribes along their way. My uncle gave the diamond to his future wife as an engagement ring, and the stone fell out of its setting and was lost. Allegedly, my father saved the day by saying that even if it was replaced with a new stone, it would still carry what makes it special in story and memory. 

I decided to approach the candlesticks by figuratively wrapping the shape of the absent candlesticks in the stories they represent.

Each of the images etched on the candlesticks reflects a powerful moment in my family's travel with my grandmother to her childhood home of Lithuania. 

**A takeaway about making:** I really loved the iterative process I went through with this piece, working one step at a time with paper cutouts until I found my footing and decided how to see this piece to completion. 

**A takeaway about the therapy:** Having to depend on a laser cutter outside of our space turned the making of this piece from empowering, to deeply frustrating. Having negative experiences getting the piece finished tainted my relationship to it in ways which I think may be detrimental to the therapeutic value of the project. I'd like to continue to explore how bumps and challenges along the way can be part of the therapy, not a detriment to it. 

**Challah Cover**

For the challah cover I chose to start with the recipe, and to incorporate the tree of life motif from the candlesticks and blessing. I set the goal to write a poem, and Febo helped me turn the words of the recipe into a poem. The poem is meant to express the spirit of shabbat—of stopping what you are doing to rest—using the language of the recipe. Ultimately, the poem shows up in the challah cover embedded in the recipe, not as a standalone.

This is the original recipe alongside the poem:

**A takeaway about making:** This piece turned out to be *slow*. Embroidery is slow and annoying, and may not be a medium I choose to work in regularly. 

**A takeaway about the therapy:** I was so avoidant about the poem, and ultimately it felt really great to try it. With Febo's support it is actually something I feel positive and proud about, which is a huge surprise given how I started out feeling about writing a poem.
