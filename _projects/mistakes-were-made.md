I stumbled across the phrase "handmade vs. homemade" on a craft blog recently. Handmade, it posited, is elegant and beautiful. Homemade, on the other hand, is the tacky and unsophisticated work of an amateur crafter. If you are going to make your own clothes, strive for handmade. *Follow these instructions closely* they warn, *or else* you will end up with a garment that looks homemade. 

Despite their dire warnings, I do not follow these instructions closely enough, and nothing I have ever made has truly transcended homemade. My work always has mistakes, not just because just about everything I make I am making for the first time, but I propose, because I am a human being. 

The internet offers us 2 templates for the craft blog:
- The aspirational: There are so many blogs dedicated to how to achieve the perfect product. [This article on the Grainline Blog](https://grainlinestudio.com/2018/09/03/strategic-backtack-placement/) about strategic backtack placement serves as a perfect examplar of the aspirational form of craft blogs. 
- The send up: Nothing is more fun than making fun of others' failures. The internet delivers on this with a [robust](https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-pinterest-fails/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic) [assortment](https://www.netflix.com/title/80179138) of [offerings](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/regretsy-closure) deriding and mocking those crafters with hubris to fly too close to the sun.  

In this blog, I am offering a middle path. Just because the things I make will never be perfect doesn't mean I'll resign myself to making crappy projects. Nor does it mean I want to be forever ruled by feelings of failure and inadequacy when my finished product doesn't measure up to the Granline Blog. 

[These pages](https://jolly-euler-5e7006.netlify.com/) will be a tribute to the experience of making things from scratch, and what it has to teach me about my relationshiop to perfectionism, and my relationship to the crooked timber of humanity.
