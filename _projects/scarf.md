A few years ago, I made my mom a scarf out of a beautiful piece of Liberty of London pomegranate printed fabric. There were many, many reasons it was a thoughtful gift, and one I thought she would find special. In my memory, when I gave her the scarf, her reaction was‚Ä¶ tepid. She said a lukewarm thank you, and she commented on how I didn‚Äôt do the right kind of hem. Fancy scarf hems are supposed to be hand slip-stitched, she pointed out, not machine hemmed. Later, my mom insisted that she'd reacted warmly to the gift, but the whole thing still left me disappointed. 

For the last few years, a small remnant of that fabric has been sitting in my scrap pile, practically radioactive in its symbolism of yearning and futility. I haven‚Äôt been able to use it, and I haven‚Äôt been able to throw it away. As the years have gone by my relationship with my mom has broken down further and further, to the point where I allow her practically no access to me. Still, this little scrap of fabric is just sitting there, daring me to find a way to make something with it.

A few weeks ago, an opportunity presented itself to use the fabric. Given a day to do a project related to imperfection and mistakes, I turned to this fabric as inspiration. I thought I could apply the idea of [kintsugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi)--golden joinery, or making an object's scars a part of its beauty--to this tiny emotional disappointment. In kintsugi, rather than avoiding a blemish or imperfection, the creator draws the viewer‚Äôs attention right to it through its golden embellishment. This seemed the perfect frame for validating my reaction to this disappointing moment, despite the fact my mother would sooner erase it. 

I wondered if I could make something for myself that I would actually enjoy out of this sad little scrap of fabric. What emerged from that day is this scarf. I do find it beautiful and wearable, but more importantly, it allowed me to take the energy I spent on my mom and to turn it inward as an act of self-care instead. Unlike my mom, I decided that when I received this gift from myself I would notice and acknowledge the care, the noticing of myself, and the attention to detail that went into it by writing myself a thank you note. 

#### Design Choices: 
- Choosing the style: When I started thinking about the project, I considered making a scarf that would prominently feature the pomegranate fabric. I immediately felt that I did not want to wear it and have to see it, and considered ways to incorporate the fabric but not show it very much. I settled on the idea of a cowl scarf, a style I knew I would enjoy, where the pomegranate fabric makes only small appearances as an accent. 
- Choosing fabric: [Here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/E6o6B72MEdLQLyW59) you can follow along with my visit to Gather Here to buy materials. 
- The lining and the pocket: I decided to line the scarf with the pomegranate fabric, and cut holes to expose small bits of the pomegranate fabric over time. I used a zipper pocket as an accent, and so I would retain access to the inside so I could make changes. I may choose to expose more and more of the pomegranate fabric, as my emotional experience and the role my mom plays in my life changes over time. I may not. 
- The dinosaur patch: As I began to chip away at the fabric to reveal the pomegranates, I realized that I simply didn't want to. This project was about givin my mom less space to affect me, not more. Instead of embellishing the scarf with the pomegranates representing  my mother, I added a dinosaur to represent myself.

- The hem: I chose to use golden thread to crearte a hem by hand in the style my mom said it should be. This felt like the most direct way to invoke the idea of the golden scar. I find it dificult to articulate why, but it feels irreverent in a way that I enjoy. 

#### The Thank you Note:
*Dear Miriam,*

*I love the colors; that green and gray are so perfect for me. I love the way you used a material that I‚Äôve been avoiding, but included just the right amount. 
You know I like to process and gradually increase my exposure over time, and you showed it in the way you left room for me to keep decorating and revealing more of the pomegranate fabric. And, I can tell from that little rolled hem detail that you really took the story about my mom and that original scarf seriously. 
Most of all, I appreciate that it is warm and cozy. Everyone needs a little nurturing from time to time, and whenever I wrap myself up in it it will remind me that I have what I need to nurture myself.*

*With gratitude,*
*Miriam*

#### About the process:
<details><summary>üß†Insights and Ideas</summary>
	<ul>
		<li>I see a clear line between this experience of giving my mom a gift an dhaving her notice only its flaws, and my overall perfectionism in the things I make. This project forced me ot stop and critique the idea that I could have created the perfect thing that would have prevented this disappointing interaction. </li>
		<li>In mid-morning on project day I noticed how my relationship to my creations' imperfections mirrors my mom's relationship to my imperfections. I di not want it to be that way, so I chose to focus my process on accepting and embracing the form the scarf took, rather than trying to wrangle it into th eperfect thing I envisioned at the start of the day. </li>
