The Normal Woman is an essay which looks at ideas about what it means to be normal through the lens of one very odd historical anecdote--the invention of a composite statue of an "average woman" and the cultural confusion and conflation of whether she is average, normal, perfect, or ideal. 

The introduction to the piece follows, and the whole piece (when it is complete) can be viewed [here](https://www.notion.so/powderhouse/The-Normal-Woman-2342c4b75ec544b0bc5b59e9aa71f03c). The story of how I made it and what I learned along the way can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/powderhouse/Final-Project-Story-2c709f54bc214a85ac5e2097a2a69b0f).

*What does it mean to have a normal body? Lots of us wonder that when we look in the mirror, check someone out on the street, or try on clothes in a fitting room. How do we know what a normal body is? How do we know if ours is normal? Who gets to decide? Normal doesn't just matter to our self esteem (although it definitely does matter to our self esteem) it has life altering consequences through its agents: BMI designating which bodies are "overweight", IQ designating which minds are "intelligent", diagnosis and standardization of all kinds. When wielded by medical professionals, institutions and states these agents of normalcy and deviance grant or deny access to healthcare, education, resources, and power. But, while the idea of normal has an awful lot of power in our culture, normal is an enigmatic standard. It's hard to say for sure what it actually means to be normal.*   

*While countless think pieces have been written about Barbie, Norma is another pretend woman whose story has a lot to tell us about American culture, and who hasn't gotten nearly as much attention. She is one half of a pair of composite statues made in the 1940s. Norma and her "male counterpart" Normman are called composite statues because they were made, as their names suggest, to represent a large group of Americans, and in doing so, an attempt to distill all the variety and difference in the population into one representative form. While it may be hard to imagine as a reader in 2019, composite statues like Norma and Normman were actually pretty famous in the 1940s—when they debuted at the Cleveland Museum of Health thousands of people flocked to see them, and Norma in particular inspired widespread media coverage and a beauty contest entered by thousands of women to find the woman who most closely matched her measurements.* 

*Norma's story is a lens through which we can view the culture that created and interpreted her—its gendered double standards, its beauty ideals, and how that culture labored to define what it means to have a good enough American body (spoiler alert: she's white, able-bodied, thin and even—remarkably for a statue!—a woman of Christian faith). The stories people told about her also reveal a lot about how culture conflates and confuses the average with the ideal, how the tools of descriptive statistics can be made by culture into prescriptions for how people should be and who is deviant, and why categorizing people as normal and abnormal is almost always a dangerous idea. And, we can read Norma's story as a cautionary tale about how political and cultural ideas are propped up by the trappings of scientific objectivity.* 

*I got Norma-curious when she started showing up in critical and historical writing about all these ideas, but I also noticed records of what actually went down around Norma were hard to come by, and often contradicted each other. Like plenty of other real women, it turns out that Norma's story is incomplete. She's featured in lot of stories where she is a prop to make a point, but her true and complete story gets short shrift. Like many folks who've written about Norma before me I do have a point to make, but I also present to you as complete and accurate a telling of Norma's story as I can construct from newspapers and popular media from 1945, and the publications and correspondence of the people who were instrumental in Norma's fame.* 

*At the end of the day, Norma's story reveals an idea that was readily available at the time, but got very little attention in the hubbub surrounding her: there's no such thing as the normal woman; a normal population is made up of a whole bunch of variation, and one of the most "normal" things in nature is variety.*
