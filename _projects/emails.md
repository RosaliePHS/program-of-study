## About the project

As I began to explore *Brilliant Imperfection*, I found myself compelled to start at the beginning—by diving into the heart of my own relationship with imperfection, perfection, brokenness and repair: my relationship with my mother. Mothering is the beginning of an awful lot of human stories, after all. 

The raw material to explore this was readily available to me in the form of 5 years of email and text communication. That's because about 5 years ago, I asked my mother to communicate with me predominantly by email and text message, and slowly over the years that predominantly has become exclusively. An unexpected side effect of communicating only by texts and emails, is that it created a nearly comprehensive record of our relationship. This project grew out of the realization that if I can’t make meaning of this relationship with the strength of my memory alone, perhaps I could create an artifact that makes my own story legible to me. 

I started with data visualization, hoping to create a representation of the messages that would surface some coherent meaning, a pattern, really anything at all to guide me towards understanding and a next step. What I found was chaos. So, I decided instead to tackle it one artifact at a time, seeing if I couldn't make—pun intended—my way towards understanding through a more tangible set of explorations. 

As much as this is an exploration of myself, it is as much an exploration of what it means to use my practice as a maker and designer as a therapeutic modality—a thing I've been referring to as [therapeutic making](https://www.notion.so/powderhouse/Exploring-Therapeutic-Making-b047977ecf254928aaa55ac069c99ba2). Immersing myself in this project allowed me to cultivate the beginnings of how I might share these tools with others. 

## Artifacts:

Each of these artifacts is an exploration of some aspect of the relationship and myself. Each one taught me something about the making and something about the therapeutic in therapeutic making.  

**Golden Hem Scarf**

A few years ago, I made my mom a scarf out of a very special piece of Liberty of London pomegranate printed fabric. In my memory, when I gave her the scarf, I was excited for her to experience my thought and care, but her reaction was critical. She focused on how I'd used the wrong kind of hem. For the last few years, a remnant of that fabric has been sitting in my scrap pile, practically radioactive in its symbolism of yearning and futility. I haven’t been able to use it, and I haven’t been able to throw it away. I wondered if I could apply the idea of [kintsugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi)–golden joinery, or making an object’s scars a part of its beauty–to this tiny emotional disappointment. What emerged from that exploration is this scarf. I find it beautiful and wearable, but more importantly, it allowed me to take the energy I spent on my mom and to turn it towards an act of self-care instead. 

- A kernel of what I discovered about making: I usually start sewing with a very clear vision of what I am making, usually a pattern. For this project I chose to take it one step at a time and respond to the materials. Stopping at each decision point and asking, 'what's next?' led to a more aesthetically satisfying product, and a more emotionally satisfying process, than working from a pattern.
- A kernel of what I discovered about the therapy: Choosing a medium matters. Bringing a project with such emotional weight and vulnerability into a new workplace was terrifying. People can only tolerate so much feeling bad before we shut down. Filling up with a positive feeling, like [competence](https://www.notion.so/powderhouse/Exploring-Therapeutic-Making-b047977ecf254928aaa55ac069c99ba2#36f11ce1bf114cb88ef1be182859a8cf), can help bolster us and steady us to take on something hard. Beginning with sewing—a medium I am deeply comfortable in—allowed me to take a risk emotionally, by staying in my comfort zone technically. No matter how painful and hard the day of work on the project might be, choosing a medium in my comfort zone guaranteed I'd complete the project with something acceptable to show for it and gave me a comfortable place to go when I wanted to take a break from thinking about the emotional content and focus on the stitches.

**Splitting Accordion Book**

<img src="/images/splitting1.png" width="45%">
<img src="/images/splitting2.png" width="45%">

*Splitting is a term used in psychology to describe a defense mechanism deployed when one is unable to hold opposing thoughts, feelings, or beliefs. Rather than reconcile the complex or ambiguous subject, it is split, and viewed intermittently as totally good (idealization), or totally bad (devaluation).* The contents of this book are excerpted from five years of text messages and emails from my mother. Expanded vertically, you will find as much as fits of the long chain of the conversation unedited, but not legible. Each spread contains a message of idealization in blue contrasted with a message of devaluation in red. The salient excerpts here are divorced from chronology, instead they illustrate how it feels to be the recipient of these messages—declaring me in turn to be the best and most loving daughter then the worst and most callous narcissist. The messages capture my mother's emotional truth in the moment each was written—her pain and her loss, her pride and her love. What they fail to capture is me. 

- A kernel of what I discovered about making: Choosing the right medium and form matter. This book started out a poster, but the accordion book was the absolutely right form for this to take for 3 reasons: 1) it unfurls to show it's whole length 2) it makes facing pages meaningful 3) you can set it up so it's like a hologram with all the negatives visible from one side and the positives from another.
- A kernel of what I discovered about the therapy: Early in the process of making this , I was asked who the audience for the piece was. Up to that moment I had thought of myself as the audience, but it became clear that was incomplete. I realized I needed an audience outside of me who could provide [validation and witnessing](https://www.notion.so/powderhouse/Exploring-Therapeutic-Making-b047977ecf254928aaa55ac069c99ba2#af038f7db64e4c46a96522b4edb6d86b) to my experience. Recognizing that need allowed me to take control over what and how to share with an audience in order to get the validation I needed back from them.

**Etch a sketch**

<img src="/images/etchasketch.jpg" width="90%">

*Dissociative disorders involve disconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions and identity. Dissociation is a survival mechanism for trauma and stress, enabling the mind to escape what it finds intolerable. Everyone dissociates from time to time, we call it "spacing out." But, severe, prolonged, and involuntary episodes of dissociation can impair one's ability to form new memories; this process is called dissociative amnesia.* A phrase I have begun to use as a shorthand to describe the experience of relating to my mother is that "she has no past and future, only the present moment." My roommate described this as being like an etch-a-sketch, every time you shake it the current reality disappears and you get a completely new one. I made this little artifact to evoke the experience I have when I receive a message from my mother: It is entirely without context, it could say literally anything, and she will forget it was ever written moments after hitting send. She's counting on me forgetting too. 

- A kernel of what I discovered about making: For this project the bulk of the work was problem solving. How to break the etch a sketch apart, how to hold the iPad inside, how to capture the shake of the iPad, how to close it all back up still looking like an etch a sketch. Having technical problems to solve was grounding while working on something emotionally charged.
- A kernel of what I discovered about the therapy: [I use humor](https://www.notion.so/powderhouse/Exploring-Therapeutic-Making-b047977ecf254928aaa55ac069c99ba2#664cfb554e9f4a22ab13e022e72a0473) defensively, and I'm definitely not alone in that. Humor lets me to go straight to the  punchline, and say "I already know this is going to be funny one day. Let's just agree it's funny now." Humor says I don't need your empathic connection, your pitying smile, or your offer of help. Using humor allows me to put a thing out into the world and keep what comes back at arm's length. There was nothing defensive or funny about the Splitting Book, so it doesn't surprise me at all that I came back to the safe cocoon of humor for the next project.

**Message Undeliverable: A Strategy Game**

<img src="/images/game1.jpg" width="45%">
<img src="/images/game2.jpg" width="45%">

When I was reading through the correspondence it stood out to me that all of my mom’s behavior is fueled by a desperate wish to keep me close to her. She’ll say and do just about anything if she thinks it has a chance of getting my attention, and she switches approach quickly as she exhausts her options. She'd just as happily get an angry reaction from me as a loving one, any strategy she can use to bring me closer is a win for her. I also saw in my responses to her that I have a set of strategies too. While she and I are both using strategies, the way we play is extremely different. Where I was careful, cautious, and strategic she was impulsive and emotional. Eventually, coming to the decision to cut off communication was largely realizing we weren’t playing the same game, and I was never going to be able to get her to play by my rules, any more than I was willing to play by hers. I decided to try to capture our communication in the form of a game to evoke in other people how it feels to come to the realization that the only way to win is not to play. 

- A kernel of what I discovered about making: I was done with this project before it was done with me. I forgot how much work goes into making a game, how many drafts and play tests it takes to get it right, and how many cards to think up and write. I wanted to be done long before the artifact was really finished, and it left me asking about the role of the quality of the artifact itself in a therapeutic project. Do I need to finish a high quality game to finish the project?
- A kernel of what I discovered about the therapy: This project gave me an opportunity to look at some numeric data from the emails. Seeing charts and graphs of how many unkind emails vs, kind emails were sent, or how few times I lost my temper over 5 years, was reassuring in a way that swimming around in the qualitative data wasn't. What this points to for me is that material with the appearance of objectivity is powerful and reassuring, and that engagement with [data, evidence and facts](https://www.notion.so/powderhouse/Exploring-Therapeutic-Making-b047977ecf254928aaa55ac069c99ba2#0522108cc36344dd9873fd99da960411) is an important piece of what making with digital tools can offer.

**An Unsent letter**

Sometime last winter, I received an extremely enraging letter. In my certainty that my mother was part of the conspiracy to send this letter (ostensibly not from her), and inhabiting fully the idea that anything I sent to the sender would be read by her, I wrote a brief and wrathful little screed expressing my wish to run over her beloved garden with a jeep. Since I wrote that unsent note the image of running over the garden with a jeep has become my go to revenge fantasy, the loop I play in my mind when I let myself get angry. Of course, I would never really do it. Not because I'm scared of the consequences, but because the high road is all I have. 

- A kernel of what I discovered about making: Along the way in this project I considered whether to have the jeep be moved by me or automate it. In this case I chose to make the flashy thing instead of the simple thing, in part because it felt good to meet the weakness I feel when I think about this content with the strength I feel when I make cool stuff.
- A kernel of what I discovered about the therapy: I was genuinely surprised by the release I felt when I finished building this scene. Making this scene allowed me to live fully in the emotional experience of doing this violent thing—how it would feel, what it would sound and look like, how I would do it—without having to suffer the practical or emotional consequences of actually doing it. I was surprised by the power of my own imagination to provide this release of anger from such an act of defiance as small as building a diorama.

This project is situated in a larger exploration of what it might mean to engage a design practice as a therapeutic modality. Throughout my work on this project I've paid particular attention to the therapeutic experiences I am having, and considered how to identify and understand factors at work in making the project a healing one. Insights from this project and others about the therapeutic impact of design practice are explored in greater depth here:
