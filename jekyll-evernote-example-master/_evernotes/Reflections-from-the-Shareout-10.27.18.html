<div>Questions I posed and big takeaways:</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>How to engage in the project in a meaningful way without sharing the content of the emails and what is next step?</div>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div>Documentation and making sure to capture the meta of this process = IMPORTANT</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>Shaunalynn’s framing of 3 levels of engagement</div>
    </li>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <div>Do specific projects (embroidery, visualizations, etc)</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>Longer term goal such as committing to a public exhibition (even if that means putting the emails bound in a plexiglass glass box so nobody can see them)</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>Meatier thing around the meta—what does this mean to my PoS? What does it mean about my therapeutic practice? Specific interesting question is what is the place in Art Tx for making high quality, deep projects </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <div>What does this have to do with my PoS?</div>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div>Rosalie talked about how its one thing to come to terms with our imperfections, but they also have interpersonal impacts</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>Shaunalynn—what if we are already perfect? Could look at the friction of people’s imperfections meeting each other, or you could say everyone is perfect and also the choice to create distance is then also perfect </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>Alec’s framing of why this is connected to “Beautiful Imperfection":</div>
    </li>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <div>To what extent does this connect me to my own imperfection? 'I should be loved regardless of whether I’m derelict' vs. ‘There’s no such thing as derelict'</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>Zooming out to view this through the lens of the tension I feel around my relationship to disability and mental illness inside vs. outside my family </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <li>
      <div>Idea that perfectionism is a trap—kept me believing if I could just craft the right text or email I would stop being hurt. Made me think I had control when I really didn’t. </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div>Recommendations I got:</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>Shaunalynn—poem about “A Perfect Son” </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>Febo-erasure poems</div>
  </li>
</ul>
