It seems to me that while nature seems to thrive through variation and diversity, humans have spent much of our history building systems (see: capitalism) that reward sameness and alienate individuals from our uniqueness. </span></div><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);">Even though I’m still struggling to articulate it, when I landed on this question I felt viscerally that it is the thread that connects me as a human being, my work as a designer/maker, and my work as a clinician/caregiver. </span><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);">Because I feel tension between my relationship to others’ imperfections and my relationship to my own, this line of inquiry feels deeply relevant—urgent even—to my own personal and emotional development. It is also important to me as a clinician/therapist because I think helping people replace shame with self-worth is essentially what that role means, and that “Brilliant imperfection” is my angle on that. I also care about this from a political perspective, because a world that is just and has a place in it for everyone has to be a world where people are valued as individuals and whose individual needs are met fully, and that means building systems that value uniqueness rather than sameness (imperfection rather than perfection?). [</span><a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/AfkPhCu9EtlLTZBkUrQVQzH8woeYUczKcPQ">This is the list of reading that means a lot to me</a><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);"> that I shared with Alec and Shaunalynn when I first joined PHS—Much of it is relevant to my program of study, particularly the disability justice angle]. Retroactively, I think I can view my </span><a href="http://www.miriamzisook.com/projects/">design practice</a><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);"> as having been about designing ways to smooth the interfaces between individual messy and chaotic humans and between those humans and the social structures we’ve built that don’t accommodate them (us?).  </span></div><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);">I think this frame is going to be meaningful for youth because developing identity is the main goal of adolescent development, and the pressure to be perfect/the same as everyone else is huge during that time. I think activities that celebrate uniqueness and deviance are inherently valuable to adolescents for that reason, whether they are directly pointed at that or looking at it sideways through lighter hearted framings. I also think this frame is valuable for thinking about how PHS build supportive systems for a wide range of humans to thrive. And, there’s an angle on how project doing (and how we meet the mistakes and screw-ups inherent to it) can be emotionally therapeutic that I think is an essential ingredient of what we’re offering young people. </span></div><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);">There are a handful of big questions and ideas that have come up in exploring this so far. One is whether the goal is to take what we once viewed as imperfect and shift the prism to see it’s inherent perfection, or </span><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);">if the goal is to throw out the frame of perfection and imperfection completely? </span><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);">In that vein I am wondering to what extent “imperfect” and “unique” are synonymous with each other (or euphemistic?) </span><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);">Another question is around whether what makes the imperfect meaningful is in our relationship to it, and the impact of interaction that meets imperfection with grace. Something I appreciated in the </span><a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/Afng4GhKofNEEYZ1w_asX94FVGEzJr-jv8w">initial discussion of this idea</a><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);"> was Rosalie observing that this frame creates a sense of collective ownership of disability justice, by positing a human right to live without shame and have our differences accepted, validated, and supported.  </span></div><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);">I see myself engaging in this exploration by bringing this reflective lens to individual projects, many of which I’d be doing anyway. Some of the projects I’ve started are: </span></div><ul><li><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 255);"> </span><a href="https://jolly-euler-5e7006.netlify.com/" style="color: rgb(39, 39, 255); font-style: italic;">Mistakes Were Made</a><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);">: I make a lot of my own clothes, and really love cooking and crafting for others as well. This is a domain of my life where my perfectionism problem is very apparent and available, but also not too emotionally charged to be a good learning zone. I decided to create a blog to explore, and hopefully </span><span style="caret-color: rgb(39, 39, 40); color: rgb(39, 39, 40);">remediate,</span><font color="#272728"> my relationship to perfection. I chose a blog in particular for 2 main reasons: 1) to develop my narrative competency 2) because the form of the craft blog, usually focused on how to make things as perfect and <span style="caret-color: rgb(39, 39, 40);">“</span> pretty” as possible, is a fun foil for this project. So far, having this lens has already made my crafting practice a lot more generative and interesting for me. </font></div></li><li><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40); font-style: italic;">A very odd and slightly uncomfortable project regarding my mother</span><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);">: One thing about me is I</span><span style="caret-color: rgb(39, 39, 40); color: rgb(39, 39, 40);">’</span><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);">m mostly estranged from my parents and extended family.

I am still working on articulating how this connects my program of study, but it feels clear (at least to Alec) that it does somehow.

There is a <a href="https://jolly-euler-5e7006.netlify.com/2018/10/24/hostile-scarf">briefer post</a> about this on Mistakes Were Made, and this is a bit more detail if you’re interested. </div></li><li><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;">Clinical practicum and supervision: One of my major goals this year is to develop my skills as a clinician, and I'm in the process of setting up some kind of clinical practicum and supervision. I think therapeutic making* could be a thing, and I’m excited about defining that thing and exploring what it could be. I think that explicitly engaging my program of study questions through a therapeutic making frame is an opportunity to figure out what that practice means for me, and to begin to ask questions about what it could look like to invite other people into that type of process. (*When I say therapeutic making I mean something that extends expressive/art therapy by using deeper and more rigorous project work as a therapeutic/healing modality.) </div></li><li><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;">Maker Club: I run a weekly program at Perkins School for the Blind where the kids do hands-on craft, engineering and art type things. I really want to find a way to tie it in to my program of study, because it’s been feeling a bit stale to me lately. I’m not exactly sure what that would look like, but I am optimistic you can help me think about that. </div></li><li><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);"> </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zz13mEvNpshRMb1i2QAVuVT61F3exZsP?usp=sharing" style="color: rgb(39, 39, 255);">This is a folder of initial brainstorms</a><span style="color: rgb(39, 39, 40);"> of projects and programs from our brainstorming exercise last week.

One is continuing to frame and draw out the overall questions and ideas. I have a sense that I’m defining my program of study slightly too broadly right now. The main evidence for that is that I can think of practically nothing in my day to day life that I couldn’t include, which seems like a clue it’s too broad. Another area I need support is specifically workshopping pieces. In the emails project and the blog I feel like I have aesthetic, writing and craft questions that would really benefit from critique and another set of eyes problem solving and helping me develop my skills. I also think I would benefit from your help envisioning how Maker Club can be part of my program of study work.  </div><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: start; text-indent: 0px;">I’m super excited and grateful for your support and really looking forward to our ongoing conversations!

I know how uncomfortable I am with my own imperfection in part because of how emotionally fraught and challenging it was for me to enter into this team with the emphasis so strongly on “bringing our whole selves.” I think this question is the most urgent question to me right now in terms of my own emotional and personal development. </span></div></li></ul><div><br/></div></body></html>
