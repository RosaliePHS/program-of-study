	<div class='quoteHeader'>"What this means is that you must learn to use your life experience in your intellectual work: continually to examine and interpret it. In this sense craftsmanship is the center of yourself and you are personally involved in every intellectual product upon which you may work. To say that you can have experience, means, for one thing, that your past plays into and affects your present, and that it defines your capacity for future experience. As a social scientist, you have to control this rather elaborate interplay, to capture what you experience and sort it out; only in this way can you hope to use it to guide and test your reflection, and in the process shape yourself as an intellectual craftsman. But how can you do this? One answer is: you must set up a file, which is, I suppose, a sociologist's way of saying: keep a journal. Many creative writers keep journals; the sociologist's need for systematic reflection demands it."</div><span class='attribution'> -—C. Wright Mills</span>

	<h3>Fieldnotes on Therapuetic Making</h3>
	<p>I've been thinking for a long time about how learning to make things and think like a designer changes people. But, being pretty sure something is happening and deeply understanding what that something is and how it works are different. To really learn from my experiences as a maker and designer—-and my experiences facilitating the making and designing of others—-I need to learn from them on purpose. To learn from them requires carefully observing, capturing what happened, and reflecting deeply on what it meant. <a href="https://www.notion.so/powderhouse/Therapeutic-Moments-In-Making-What-happened-and-what-does-it-mean-1563aab54ff3433e94ef5e136a7714c9" target="_blank">This document</a> is a collection of anecdotes from my practice as a maker and my experiences facilitating maker experiences for others where I build towards deeper understanding of what makes making and design special sites for developing capacity and self-worth.</p>
