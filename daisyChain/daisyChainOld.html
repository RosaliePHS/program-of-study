				<div class=article-title>9 simple rules for dressing when fat</div>
				<div class="article-author">by Miriam Zisook</div>
				<div class="article-body">

					<div class='intro'>
						<div class='bad'>Nobody wants to look fat, but there are so many myths out there about how to dress your best. Here we wade through the myths to share 9 tried and true tips for dressing to fit and flatter. Look 10 pounds thinner by tonight if you follow these wardrobe tricks.</div>
						<div class='good'>Most women, especially fat* women, are taught that the paramount rule of getting dressed is to flatter our figures. We keep a list of rules in our minds against which to evaluate every possible outfit. Is it too tight? Too bold? Too exposing? When we see beautiful clothes we think, 'maybe when we lose weight.' When we see something beautiful on another woman's body we think, "I could never pull that off." When following the standard rules set by society, choosing clothing sure is boring and fills us with self loathing. Here's a new list of fashion rules, to present ourselves with joy, to play with new ways to express ourselves, to be comfortable in our own skins, and and to raise a big fat middle finger to the patriarchy. 
						</div>

							</div>
							<div class='rule-body'>
								"Look taller and trimmer by dressing monochromatically head to toe. "Lose" five pounds by matching your pants or skirt, stockings and shoes. You'll seem 10 pounds lighter if they're all black! Bright colors and prints will call unnecessary attention to your shape and make you look bigger. Is the one-color thing too tame for your taste? Slip on a pair of bright shoes to shake things up." 
							</div>
							<div class='img-box'>
								<img class='rule-img' src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/97/31/0a/97310a7457bbab935bdbd5faf1439df8.jpg"  alt="Selena Gomez dressed head to toe in black">

						<div class='good'>
							<div class='rule-title'>
								1. Look Joyful in Bright Colors
							</div>
							<div class='rule-body'>
								Clothes aren't just meant to hide your body, they can also be for fun and decoration. When you wear unique and playful pieces, especially handmade by you, you won't just see clothing as camouflage, you'll hope to get noticed. There's nothing better than answering a compliment with, "Thanks, I made it!"

							<div class='rule-body'>"If your legs are one of your worry zones, you’re in luck! Midi-length skirts are perennially in style, and the combination of extra fabric and a cinch at the waist never fail to flatter your figure. Go for a hemline that hits below the kneecap to make legs look their absolute best."</div>

							</div>
						</div>

						<div class='good'>
							<div class='rule-title'>
								2. Don't let anyone else's opinions be the boss of you 
							</div>
							<div class='rule-body'>
								When you think of wearing a short skirt maybe, like me, you think of that time in college when you were out to lunch with a man (ahem, dad) and asked him to stop leering at that short skirt-wearing waitress. Maybe that man (ahem, dad) retorted, "You're just jealous because you can't wear a skirt like that." No? That didn’t happen to you? Ok, well whatever your version of the too-short skirt story is, maybe it gave you the idea you'd look disgusting and be de-sexualized in a too short skirt. Maybe that made you realize that if you were lucky enough not to be desexualized, the only other option was to be leered at and hyper-sexualized. Not great options. Put on a short skirt and don't give those gross sexist comments any more power for even one more minute.

								<div class='about-outfit'><i style="" class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>  about this outfit: <p><stromg>Pattern:</stromg> Self-drafted skirt, top and jacket are RTW (ready to wear, i.e. store bought)</p><p><strong>Fabric:</strong> Ponte diRoma</p></div>

							<div class='rule-title'>3. Skin Tight Dresses—Might Not Be A Great Idea</div>
							<div class='rule-source'><a target="_blank" href="https://www.liveabout.com/styles-that-make-women-look-fat-2658614">10 Styles that Make Women Look Fat</a></div>
							<div class='rule-body'>"Wearing a dress that's skin-tight is a big mistake if you want to look thinner and taller. If a dress feels tight, if horizontal wrinkles are appearing (especially across the bust, hips, or thighs), or if lumps and bumps are clearly visible, the dress does not belong in your wardrobe. The too-tight dress effect is likely to be multiplied if the dress also has other unflattering features, such as being too short or too revealing. Certain fabrics can also compound the fattening effect."</div>

								3. Don't give a f*ck in a tight dress
							</div>
							<div class='rule-body'>
								Recently I came across an online trend in the sewing community: #wiggledress. Wiggle dresses are dresses so tight you have to wiggle into them, and curvy sewists the world over are posting photos of themselves looking spectacular in them. Maybe, like I used to before I saw so many women looking so freaking fabulous in them, you think of wiggle dresses as anathema to curvy dressing. Try going way the hell out of your comfort zone and wearing one. When you wince at yourself in it, think of how beautiful those other women look in them and remind yourself the problem with your body might just be in your head (planted there by—-you guessed it—-patriarchy).

							<div class='rule-body'>"For years mothers have told their daughters that horizontal stripes do the female figure no favors and that vertical ones are more flattering. As a result, many women have spent their lives avoiding horizontal hoops for fear of looking fat." "Val Watham, 53, was unconvinced by research which claimed horizontal stripes flatter the figure. She undertook her own research, dressing models in a variety of striped designs and asking members of the public to rate their appearance. The findings demonstrated that horizontal stripes do make people appear wider, while vertical stripes make people appear taller."</div>

								4. Never change your stripes
							</div>
							<div class='rule-body'>
								For years I didn't wear horizontal stripes because my mom said they make me look fat. Oh really! Your mom too?! What a coincidence! That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard—as if someone can't tell what I look like when I wear polka dots but my body blows up like a blimp (thanks Mom for the blimp comparison) in stripes. A tiger can’t change her stripes, and neither should you! Make yourself a whole bunch of fun clothes with horizontal stripes to celebrate saying goodbye to this nonsense fashion rule.

								5. Be extremely comfortable in leggings as pants
							</div>
							<div class='rule-body'>
								When leggings first started to become pants, I told myself they were only pants for thin women. Dressing for yoga and exercise meant pulling together creative outfits that hid my athleisure under tunics and skirts. I saw women all around me comfy AF in leggings, but thought that wasn't for me.  One day I didn't put my skirt back on over my leggings after yoga, and guess what happened?! Nothing. Nothing happened. See for yourself by getting yourself some bold leggings (and some plain ones) that you'll absolutely love rocking as pants. Embrace that soft caress of lycra against your liberated legs.

							<div class='rule-body'>
								In 6th grade I got a new tank top I absolutely loved. The first time I wore it outside to play in the front yard with my neighbors my mom looked at me uncomfortably and suggested it would look cute under something with sleeves. I didn't wear a sleeveless top again for more than 10 years. Oh, wow! Something like that happened to you too?! You've had enough of sweating through the summer hidden under sweaters and passing up cute tops and dresses because they're for someone else's body. Say goodbye to cardigans in 90 degree heat, and say hello to dinosaur sundresses (or the playful prints of your choice)!

								8. You have nothing to hide
							</div>
							<div class='rule-body'>
								My senior year of high school there was a day when underclassmen in stage crew dressed up  as seniors. The kid who dressed as me wore tons of layers—long sleeve T under short sleeve T, flared jeans under a knee length skirt, a cardigan, and a scarf. I've thought about that a lot since then—it was so transparent how much I was hiding. Now I sometimes just wear one thing, and you too can wear just one thing! Pick out a favorite top or dress and then stop, don't add a cardigan, don't add a jacket, no need for a scarf, just take your totally dressed enough self to into the sunshine.

								9. Really, nothing at all to hide
							</div>
							<div class='rule-body'>
								In high school when my friends went to the beach (an experience I dreaded) I wore shapewear under jeans and said I hated swimming. Years later I found an emerald green suit that fit me and I swam at the beach with friends for the first time. Turns out, the beach is my favorite place! When I saw an online campaign declaring that every body is a bikini body, it was a revelation. Here were women claiming the right to define a good enough body. Could it be that all we need to do to have a good enough body to enjoy the beach is decide our bodies are good enough to enjoy the beach?  I made myself this emerald bikini as an homage to that emerald one piece from years ago, and the first suit I ever felt comfortable in, but this time with some belly showing. Find a swimsuit you love, maybe even one that doesn't come down to your knees and elbows, maybe even one that shows a belly roll, and hit the water with nothing to hide.
