	<div class="intro">
		<p>A lot of people (especially women-identified and femme folks) face a whole lot of time worrying about how to dress to look their best, and especially to look their thinnest. All that time spent obsessing and worrying is time we're not spending having fun, doing all the things, and taking over the world. Next time you find yourself, as I often do, standing in front of your closet having tried on six outfits for the day and you still feel ugly in all of them, could you instead put something on because it's bright, comfortable, or practical and get on with your life? </p>
		<p>Imagine if instead of getting dressed to hide our imperfect bodies, we started getting dressed to express ourselves with joy, to be comfortable enough to kick ass, and to raise a big fat middle finger to the patriarchy.</p></div>

					<p>Sometimes when I go to get dressed, I remember that time my mom asked me, "Why do you insist on wearing bright colors right around the widest part of your body?" She always thought everything looked best in black. Your mom too? Our moms got raised in the same toxic culture we did, preoccupied with all the ways a woman can dress to make herself smaller. I'm over it. </p>
					<p>Before, when people commented on my clothes I felt vulnerable and embarrassed, but when I receive compliments on clothing I've made I feel powerful. When I slip into something bright and weird and handmade by me instead of hoping it makes me look smaller, I'm hoping someone will notice it, so I can proudly announce that I made it myself.</p>

					<p>When you think of wearing a short skirt maybe, like me, you think of that time in college when you were out to lunch with a man (ahem, dad) and asked him to stop leering at that short skirt-wearing waitress. Maybe that man (ahem, dad) retorted, "You're just jealous because you can't wear a skirt like that." No? That didn’t happen to you? Ok, well whatever your version of the too-short skirt story is, maybe that's how you learned you'd look disgusting and be de-sexualized in a too short skirt, and that the only other option was to be leered at and hyper-sexualized. Not great options.</p>
					<p>One day you might decide you've had it with the sexist double standard that sexualizes some women who dress in revealing clothes, but desexualizes others. You might realize that no matter what length skirt you choose, when you walk out the door you can't be safe from sexist evaluations. So, maybe one day you'll decide not to give those gross sexist standards any more power for even one more minute, and put on whatever length skirt you want to. You might feel embarrassed of your legs when you walk outside—I did—but like me you'll also know you're taking a small step to carve out a little more space on the sidewalk for others.</p>

					<p>Recently my social media filled up with pics of curvy crafters the world over looking spectacular in handmade tight dresses (#wiggledress—because they're so tight you have to wiggle into them). Maybe (like I used to before I saw so many women looking so freaking fabulous in them) you think of tight dresses as anathema to curvy dressing. I have never so much as glanced at a dress with this silhouette in a store, but making it myself meant I could guarantee it fit. That made me realize that how good a body I have doesn't depend on if the designers at J. Crew or wherever designed for my body.</p> 
					<p>Try it with me: Go way the hell out of your comfort zone and wear a #wiggledress. If you wince at yourself in the mirror, think of how beautiful those other women look in them and remind yourself the "problem" with your body might not be as visible to others as it is to you.</p>

					<p>I know that for years I didn't wear horizontal stripes because my mom said they made me look fat. Oh really! Your mom too?! What a coincidence! </p>
					<p>Stop and think about it though, it's a pretty dumb idea—as if someone can't tell what I look like when I wear polka dots but my body blows up like a blimp (thanks Mom for the blimp metaphor, really) in stripes. Who has time for this nonsense?! A tiger can’t change her stripes for anyone, and neither should you! </p>
					<p>Get out there and get (or make!) yourself a whole bunch of fun clothes with horizontal stripes to celebrate saying goodbye to this nonsense fashion rule. If you need a reason, remind yourself while you're out today a teenage girl whose mom told her she can't wear horizontal stripes might see you looking awesome. If you have a daughter and she, or anyone's daughter actually, sees you flaunting it in horizontal stripes this silly old myth can die with you.</p>

					<p>When leggings first started to become pants, I told myself they were only pants for thin women. Dressing for yoga and exercise meant pulling together creative outfits that hid my athleisure under tunics and skirts. I saw women all around me comfy AF in leggings, but thought that wasn't for me. One day I didn't put my skirt back on over my leggings after yoga, and guess what happened?! Nothing. Nothing happened. Except I was so freaking comfortable. See for yourself by getting yourself some bold leggings (and some plain ones) that you'll absolutely love rocking as pants. Embrace that soft caress of lycra against your liberated legs.</p>

					<p>In 6th grade I got a new tank top I absolutely loved. The first time I wore it outside to play in the front yard with my neighbors, my mom looked at me uncomfortably and suggested it would look cute under something with sleeves. I didn't wear a sleeveless top again for more than 10 years. Oh, wow! Something like that happened to you too?! </p>
					<p>Then, one summer I got sick of never being able to wear the cute dresses and tops I wanted because they were sleeveless. I got tired of always being hot and uncomfortable, but pretending I was cold to explain why I had a cardigan on when it was 90 degrees out. I started wearing sleeveless things out. At first just for a little while, with a security cardigan stashed in my bag. My self-consciousness didn't go away overnight, but over time I lasted longer and longer before I needed to reach for the cover up. If like me, you've had enough of sweating through the summer hiding under sweaters, say goodbye to cardigans in 90 degree heat, and say hello to dinosaur sundresses!</p>

					<p>Maybe you've heard the one about how "big girls can't wear big prints"? When clothes are camouflage, all kinds of fun styles are off limits. I've been seeing an explosion of cute jumpsuit styles, fun floral prints, and funky denims and thinking they were off limits to me. </p>
					<p>Now I present you with this rocking floral denim jumpsuit. I dare you to pick out that too bold fashion piece and wear it out—delight in how nobody but you even thinks you're doing it because I dared you—you look great! All you need to do to pull it off is put it on! Have fun soaking up smiles and compliments all day when you wear bright, playful clothes.</p></div>

				<div class='rule-body'><p>My senior year of high school there was a day when underclassmen in theatre crew dressed up as seniors. The kid who dressed as me wore tons of layers—long-sleeve-T under short-sleeve-T, flared jeans under a knee length skirt, a cardigan, and a scarf. I've thought about that a lot since then—it was so transparent how much I was hiding. Now I sometimes just wear one thing, and you too can wear just one thing! Pick out a favorite top or dress and then stop. Don't add a cardigan. Don't add a jacket. No need for a scarf. Just take your totally dressed enough self into the sunshine.</p></div>

					<p>In high school when my friends went to the beach (an experience I dreaded) I wore shapewear under jeans and said I hated swimming. Years later I found an emerald green suit that fit me and I swam at the beach with friends for the first time. Turns out, the beach is my favorite place! </p>
					<p>When I saw an online campaign declaring that every body is a bikini body, it was a revelation. Here were women claiming the right to define a good enough body. Could it be that all we need to do to have a good enough body to enjoy the beach is decide our bodies are good enough to enjoy the beach?  I made myself this emerald bikini as an homage to that emerald one piece from years ago, and the first suit I ever felt comfortable in, but this time with some belly showing.</p>
					<p>If you're sick of pretending you "don't even like summer anyway," find a swimsuit you love, maybe even one that doesn't come down to your knees and elbows, or even one that shows some belly rolls, and hit the water with nothing to hide.</p>
