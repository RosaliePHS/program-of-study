					<p>Look taller and trimmer by dressing monochromatically head to toe. "Lose" five pounds by matching your pants or skirt, stockings and shoes. You'll seem ten pounds lighter if they're all black! Bright colors and prints will call unnecessary attention to your shape and make you look bigger. Is the one-color thing too tame for your taste? Slip on a pair of bright shoes to shake things up.</p>

					<p>If your legs are one of your worry zones, you’re in luck! Midi-length skirts are perennially in style, and the combination of extra fabric and a cinch at the waist never fail to flatter your figure. Go for a hemline that hits below the kneecap to make legs look their absolute best.</p>

					<p>Wearing a dress that's skin-tight is a big mistake if you want to look thinner and taller. If a dress feels tight, if horizontal wrinkles are appearing (especially across the bust, hips, or thighs), or if lumps and bumps are clearly visible, the dress does not belong in your wardrobe. The too-tight dress effect is likely to be multiplied if the dress also has other unflattering features, such as being too short or too revealing. Certain fabrics can also compound the fattening effect.</p>

					<p>For years mothers have told their daughters that horizontal stripes do the female figure no favors and that vertical ones are more flattering. As a result, many women have spent their lives avoiding horizontal hoops for fear of looking fat." "Val Watham, 53, was unconvinced by research which claimed horizontal stripes flatter the figure. She undertook her own research, dressing models in a variety of striped designs and asking members of the public to rate their appearance. The findings demonstrated that horizontal stripes do make people appear wider, while vertical stripes make people appear taller.</p>

Jeans with straight legs almost always look better on short women (unless they wear a tiny size) than skinny jeans do.</p>

					<p>Clean, streamlined jeans are the way to go. The most flattering styles are dark and feature unembellished pockets. Avoid extra details that catch the eye and give the illusion of bulk-think twice about tags, grommets, or decorative extras. The leanest silhouettes of all: boot cut and straight leg. </p>

					<p>Layering is another technique that magically hides it all away, shifting the focus anywhere but your tummy. Combinations like the tank top with plaid shirt; knee-length dress and a cape; trousers with a shirt and blazer or shrug etc. work pretty well to your advantage. Layers that are unbuttoned gives it a significant effect making you look taller. Make-believe in the truest sense.</p>

					<p>You should try these if you have not already. They are your rescue rangers; I could not wait to get my hands on these. It basically, tucks the unflattering flab and tires back into the tummy, at least it creates the illusion.
