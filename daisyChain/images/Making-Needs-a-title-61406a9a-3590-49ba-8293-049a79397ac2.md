# *Making... Needs a title*

## About the project

As I began to explore *Brilliant Imperfection*, I found myself compelled to start at the beginning—by diving into the heart of my own relationship with imperfection, perfection, brokenness and repair: my relationship with my mother. Mothering is the beginning of an awful lot of human stories, after all. 

The raw material to explore this was readily available to me in the form of 5 years of email and text communication. That's because about 5 years ago, I asked my mother to communicate with me predominantly by email and text message, and slowly over the years that predominantly has become exclusively. An unexpected side effect of communicating only by texts and emails, is that it created a nearly comprehensive record of our relationship. This project grew out of the realization that if I can’t make meaning of this relationship with the strength of my memory alone, perhaps I could create an artifact that makes my own story legible to me. 

I started with data visualization, hoping to create a representation of the messages that would surface some coherent meaning, a pattern, really anything at all to guide me towards understanding and a next step. What I found was chaos. So, I decided instead to tackle it one artifact at a time, seeing if I couldn't make—pun intended—my way towards understanding through a more tangible set of explorations. 

As much as this is an exploration of myself, it is as much an exploration of what it means to use my practice as a maker and designer as a therapeutic modality—a thing I've been referring to as therapeutic making. Immersing myself in this project allowed me to cultivate the beginnings of how I might share these tools with others. 

## Artifacts:

Each of these artifacts is an exploration of some aspect of the relationship and myself. Each one taught me something about the making and something about the therapeutic in therapeutic making.  

**Scarf**

A few years ago, I made my mom a scarf out of a very special piece of Liberty of London pomegranate printed fabric. In my memory, when I gave her the scarf, I was excited for her to experience my thought and care, but her reaction was critical. She focused on how I'd used the wrong kind of hem. For the last few years, a remnant of that fabric has been sitting in my scrap pile, practically radioactive in its symbolism of yearning and futility. I haven’t been able to use it, and I haven’t been able to throw it away. I wondered if I could apply the idea of [kintsugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi)–golden joinery, or making an object’s scars a part of its beauty–to this tiny emotional disappointment. What emerged from that exploration is this scarf. I find it beautiful and wearable, but more importantly, it allowed me to take the energy I spent on my mom and to turn it inward as an act of self-care instead. 

- Takeaway about making: I usually start sewing with a very clear vision of what I am making, usually a pattern. For this project I chose to take it one step at a time and respond to the materials. Stopping at each decision point and asking, 'what's next?' led to a more aesthetically satisfying product, and a more emotionally satisfying process, than working from a pattern.
- Takeaway about the therapy: Choosing a medium matters. Bringing a project with such emotional weight and vulnerability into a new workplace was terrifying. Beginning with sewing—a medium I am deeply comfortable in—allowed me to take a risk emotionally, by staying in my comfort zone technically.

**Splitting**

*Splitting is a term used in psychology to describe a defense mechanism deployed when one is unable to hold opposing thoughts, feelings, or beliefs. Rather than reconcile the complex or ambiguous subject, it is split, and viewed intermittently as totally good (idealization), or totally bad (devaluation).* The contents of this book are excerpted from five years of text messages and emails from my mother. Expanded vertically, you will find as much as fits of the long chain of the conversation unedited, but not legible. Each spread contains a message of idealization in blue contrasted with a message of devaluation in red. The salient excerpts here are divorced from chronology, instead they illustrate how it feels to be the recipient of these messages—declaring me in turn to be the best and most loving daughter then the worst and most callous narcissist. The messages capture my mother's emotional truth in the moment each was written—her pain and her loss, her pride and her love. What they fail to capture is me. 

- Takeaway about making: Choosing the right medium and form matter. This book started out a poster, but the accordion book was the absolutely right form for this to take for 3 reasons: 1) it unfurls to show it's whole length 2) it makes facing pages meaningful 3) you can set it up so it's like a hologram with all the negatives visible from one side and the positives from another.
- Takeaway about the therapy: This artifact brought me into the idea of audience, and introduced me to the idea that part of what makes the project healing is engaging with what I give to an audience and what the audience gives back to me.

**Etch a sketch**

*Dissociative disorders involve disconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions and identity. Dissociation is a survival mechanism for trauma and stress, enabling the mind to escape what it finds intolerable. Everyone dissociates from time to time, we call it "spacing out." But, severe, prolonged, and involuntary episodes of dissociation can impair one's ability to form new memories; this process is called dissociative amnesia.* A phrase I have begun to use as a shorthand to describe the experience of relating to my mother is that "she has no past and future, only the present moment." My roommate described this as being like an etch-a-sketch, every time you shake it the current reality disappears and you get a completely new one. I made this little artifact to evoke the experience I have when I receive a message from my mother: It is entirely without context, it could say literally anything, and she will forget it was ever written moments after hitting send. She's counting on me forgetting too. 

- Takeaway about making: For this project the bulk of the work was problem solving. How to break the etch a sketch apart, how to hold the iPad inside, how to capture the shake of the iPad, how to close it all back up still looking like an etch a sketch. Having technical problems to solve was grounding while working on something emotionally charged.
- Takeaway about the therapy: Humor is a defense against our darker feelings, and can be deployed to help us engage more deeply, or deployed to help us avoid what is really important. It's definitely not a coincidence that after the Splitting book, which was upsetting to work on and not funny at all, I went to a project using humor for reprieve.

**Strategy Game**

When I was reading through the correspondence it stood out to me that all of my mom’s behavior is fueled by a desperate wish to keep me close to her. She’ll say and do just about anything if she thinks it has a chance of getting my attention, and she switches approach quickly as she exhausts her options. She'd just as happily get an angry reaction from me as a loving one, any strategy she can use to bring me closer is a win for her. I also saw in my responses to her that I have a set of strategies too. While she and I are both using strategies, the way we play is extremely different. Where I was careful, cautious, and strategic she was impulsive and emotional. Eventually, coming to the decision to cut off communication was largely realizing we weren’t playing the same game, and I was never going to be able to get her to play by my rules, any more than I was willing to play by hers. I decided to try to capture our communication in the form of a game to evoke in other people how it feels to come to the realization that the only way to win is not to play. 

- Takeaway about making: I was done with this project before it was done with me. I forgot how much work goes into making a game, how many drafts and play tests it takes to get it right, and how many cards to think up and write. I wanted to be done long before the artifact was really finished, and it left me asking about the role of the quality of the artifact itself in a therapeutic project. Do I need to finish a high quality game to finish the project?
- Takeaway about the therapy: This project gave me an opportunity to look at some numeric data from the emails. Seeing charts and graphs of how many unkind emails vs, kind emails were sent, or how many times I lost my temper over 5 years, was reassuring in a way that swimming around in the qualitative data wasn't.

**Unsent letter**

Sometime last winter, I received an extremely enraging letter. In my certainty that my mother was part of the conspiracy to send this letter (ostensibly not from her), and inhabiting fully the idea that anything I sent to the sender would be read by her, I wrote a brief and wrathful little screed expressing my wish to run over her beloved garden with a jeep. Since I wrote that unsent note the image of running over the garden with a jeep has become my go to revenge fantasy, the loop I play in my mind when I let myself get angry. Of course, I would never really do it. Not because I'm scared of the consequences, but because the high road is all I have. 

- Takeaway about making-Along the way in this project I considered whether to have the jeep be moved by me or automate it. In this case I chose to make the flashy thing instead of the simple thing, in part because it felt good to meet the weakness I feel when I think about this content with the strength I feel when I make cool stuff.
- Takeaway about the therapy-This artifact was about interrogating the role of anger. On the one hand, anger is a defense against grief; The time I spend angry is time I don't spend reckoning with pain and sadness. On the other hand, the time I spend not angry is time I spend blaming myself. I love a dialectic, and how to simultaneously embrace and push away anger is a good one.

## Therapeutic Factors

 I've been into the idea that design practice is therapeutic for a long time; that's what led me from design work to becoming a therapist. Before that, I'd given a lot of thought to designing tools for emotional wellbeing, but not to design as an emotional wellbeing practice. When I've thought about what is therapeutic about design practice for the designer I've usually thought about 3 main ideas: 

1. **Industry and self-efficacy:** [Erickson's theory of psychosocial development](https://www.simplypsychology.org/Erik-Erikson.html) poses that people progress through a set of developmental crises, each one preparing them for the next. One of these developmental crises is called "Industry vs. inferiority." Erickson posed that typically developing children around ages 5-12 are primarily concerned with the development of feelings of autonomy, competency, and capacity. This when kids assert that they want to do things themselves, and take the most pride in accomplishments and things they create. The foundation for feelings of [self-efficacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy) develops at this time as well. The first way I started thinking about design as an emotional intervention was in noticing for how many people developmental challenges, school failure, trauma, and other emotional challenges get in the way of the development of self-efficacy and industry. I saw learning to be a designer fundamentally as a process of learning to use one's own competence to think and solve problems in the material world, and that it could be a valuable toolset for bringing opportunities to work on these developmental skills to folks who have aged out of play and learning contexts designed for 5-12 year olds. 
2. **Social thinking:** Social skills (how to behave in social situations and comply with social norms) and social thinking (understanding why people behave the way we do and what those norms mean) can be challenging for many reasons, including developmental disability, Autism, emotional difficulties, etc. Design is often a team process, and as such, working collaboratively can be a beautiful living lab for learning to deal with other people. For people who struggle with social skills and cognition, collaborative work can be a great way to practice outside of a strictly social situation. Designing tools for social interactions (i.e. an app for workplace communication) can be a great way to help folks learn about social interactions without focusing on themselves and their own difficulties. 
3. **Problem solving and cognitive flexibility:** Design is about solving problems, and thinking of divergent solutions. For people who are rigid thinkers, using the tools of design is a great way to practice expanding thinking, thinking more flexibly, and being open to new ideas. It can help people learn to problem solve in real life (which bus to take, what time to leave for work, how to get everything you need to bring for the day to fit in your backpack) to practice by building towers out of marshmallows, learning how to give logic to a computer, or learning to break down technical problems into steps. 

This project engages those ideas, but also adds a bucket of activity I'd previously thought of as belonging only to art practice, not design practice: *design of emotionally expressive artifacts*. Up to now when I've made these types of artifacts I've seen it as switching modes from professional designer to amateur artist. Through making these artifacts, I've been noticing that I'm working with the same skillset and sensibilities I bring to design work, even though the content is emotional/affective. I'm interested in what it means to use design practice to unpack emotional experiences, and what makes it similar and different from art making and art therapy. Throughout this project I've paid attention to the therapeutic experiences I am having, and considered how to identify and understand factors at work in making the project a healing one:  

*Approaching material that wounds sense of self-worth from a place of competence and strength:* 
Most humans make meaning of difficulty in one of 2 ways, "the world is bad" or "I am bad." For the "I am bad" among us, revisiting the hard parts of life can challenge feelings of self-worth. If it is true that being able to make things is a powerful way to grow feelings of competence, self-efficacy and self-worth, then those feelings can surely strengthen and bolster the maker engaging damaging and upsetting emotional material. That means that the capacity to create high quality, high production value artifacts is a necessary prerequisite for certain types of engagement with therapeutic making. Stated in the negative: feeling incompetent as a maker would undermine the healing power of making these artifacts. 

*Exposure, immersion, and slowness:* 

In therapy *e*xposure is the idea that our bodies, minds and hearts can become less afraid of upsetting feelings and content by learning that we can draw nearer to them and survive. A person who is afraid of spiders might first expose themselves by thinking of spiders and be unable to tolerate that for more than a moment, but maybe over months or years their tolerance grows to the point where they can see a spider and know they can manage it. When I first downloaded these emails I could sit with them for just a few minutes at a time before becoming upset and needing to step away. Over weeks of work on this project my tolerance grew, and the more I can sit with them the more I can learn from them.  

Making lets me look at the content at an angle. Whole days cutting and gluing require slow, careful exposure to the content. But, because of the nature of the project work, I can look at it sideways, reading it over and over as it loses its potency, all while slightly distracted from the messages by the technical processes of making. 

Another feature of making that promotes exposure is that it makes it hard to avoid hard things. If the artifact isn't done it isn't done, and that puts just a little bit of pressure to stay with the difficult content. Being in control of the design process means the maker gets to respond to that pressure while remaining in control of their own exposure and avoiding flooding (when exposure crosses over into a harmful and overwhelming experience). I always had the option to step away from an incomplete piece, or to respond to my desire to complete it by sticking with the difficulty just a little bit longer. 

*Narrative Control, Clarity and Audience:*  

Something else that making forced me to do, besides spend time, was sharpen my own understanding of my emotional experience. In Trauma focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT) with children, the construction of a trauma narrative (a document in the child's voice telling the story of what happened and its impacts) is the culmination of the therapy process. The overall goal in trauma therapy is to give the child control of the traumatic experience—how and when to talk about it, how to tell the story, and what it means. The narrative is the child's opportunity to decide and share the meaning they have made and demonstrate control. 

When I started each artifact I had a vague idea of what it meant and what I wanted to get out of it. As I worked on each one I was forced to ask questions about what it means in order to respond to design questions. Asking whether red or blue better evokes a feeling requires asking, what is the feeling? Asking whether an audience feels the thing I want them to feel requires asking what I  want other people to understand about this? By making artifacts I was able to shift and deepen my knowledge of what think, need, want, and feel, and able to control how I shared my story. 

Before starting this project I wasn't thinking about audience. Once I realized other people were going to see what I make, I realized that how I want to use audience is a powerful part of the work. Feeling that others can share my experience, and that it can be legible, allows for validation I did not anticipate, nor know I was craving. As much as I crave the validation, exposing this content comes with overwhelming risk both that others will see it and take from it that the negative content about me is true, or that their empathy and validation will open up more grief than I can tolerate. By taking control of the narrative and making sure my designs say what I want them to say I make it possible to share what I need to share in order to receive the response from others that will help me. 

*Evidence and proof:* 

Emotional experiences are subjective, and what's upsetting to one person might not be to another. Particularly in relationships where gaslighting—making a person feel like they are crazy for feeling a certain thing, especially by denying shared reality—plays a role many people move through the world uncertain of whether they might be making something out of nothing, and exaggerating or dramatizing their own hurt and anger. Using data and evidence to explore emotional content allowed me to feel grounded in facts. It gave me access to a sense of what is true and not true driven by information, rather than by my own memories and guilt. I often ask myself if I'm being unfair to my mom, seeing the numbers on how many emails were negative and harmful lets me feel a bit more secure in my decisions. 

While working on this project I became more aware of moments in daily life where this material impacts me. Seeing that 20% of the emails I sent to my mother were a certain way allowed me to catch myself behaving that certain way in my present reality. Now that I’ve noticed it I can make a choice about when and whether to do it that I couldn’t have made before. Living for weeks with this content helped me put myself in context, and rebuild my story of myself to better explain how and why I feel and act the way I do. I am emerging from this project with a narrative of my life that is much more generous to myself than the one I brought into it. 

## Holding Environment

I didn't do this project in a vacuum, I did it at Powderhouse. Understanding the holding environment and relationships that make therapeutic making possible is essential to replicating and sharing it. There are several active ingredients in our holding environment worth calling out: 

*Shared Vulnerability*

Our team began our work together by sharing deeply who we each are and what we care about by each facilitating a day of introduction to ourself.  By starting there each person make their self vulnerable, and invited us to know them. It was introducing myself to the team that first forced me to realize how badly I needed to rewrite my story of myself. It was hearing the rest of the team share vulnerable and meaningful stories of themselves that made me understand this is a safe community to do it. 

*Permission, Invitation and Support*  

As we framed our programs of study a clear message was given that what makes work good at Powderhouse is that we care about it. When I began to work on this project, I assumed I'd be doing it outside work as a side project, but more and more the project was invited into our shared work. Having people I respect validate that the work I was doing was worth our time allowed me to take it seriously and allowed me to ask for the support, encouragement and resources I needed to do it well. The version of this project I would have done as a side project would have generated a tiny fraction of what I learned from doing it with the invitation, permission, and support of this team. 

*Explicit Conversation about Boundaries and Trust*

When I started doing this it was not clear what, if anything, about it I would want to share. Inviting me to do this project on "company time" required accepting the risk that there wouldn't be much to show for it publicly. Because our team had already learned to talk to each other about boundaries and to set clear expectations about what we need it was natural for me to come into a critique and say, "I am willing to show you this, but not that." I trust our team to keep what I ask to be private private, and to stop probing when I ask that we stop probing. It wouldn't be possible to engage this project deeply and authentically if that trust weren't established.
