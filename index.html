		<p>The world is always telling us we're not good enough.  We can choose to accept that message, and buy the things we're sold to fix ourselves. Or, we can claim the power to define our worth on our own terms. Making and design are arenas in my own life where I've begun to do this. </p>

		<p>I've found that learning to design well is helping me learn to live well.  Design requires thoughtfully defining the problem and carefully choosing standards for my solutions, and design forces me to grapple with limits and imperfection. Life does, too. We can never design the perfect solution any more than we can be the perfect person. All we can do is decide what good enough means to us. </p>
	
		<p>I want to understand how we can learn these lessons in design and translate them to the rest of our lives. My work centers two contexts very close to me where "not good enough" messaging hits the hardest: disability and body justice. <strong>This is an investigation of my own practice of design and making through this lens, and an invitation to others to design and make with me.</strong></p>
