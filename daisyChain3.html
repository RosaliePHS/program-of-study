			<div class=article-title>9 simple rules for dressing when fat</div>
			<div class="article-author">by Miriam Zisook</div>
			<div class="article-body">

				<div class='intro'>
					<div class='bad'>Nobody wants to look fat, but there are so many myths out there about how to dress your best. Here we wade through the myths to share 9 tried and true tips for dressing to fit and flatter. Look 10 pounds thinner by tonight if you follow these wardrobe tricks.</div>
					<div class='good'>Shopping for clothes has always been an emotionally loaded experience. I've cried in a lot of retail fitting rooms, and I know I'm not the only one. So many of the moments and milestones that should have been joyful for me were spent obsessing over what to wear and feeling uncomfortable in my skin and in my clothes. For me, making and altering clothing has become a way of resisting the harmful messages of my family and the diet and fashion industries. The power to make things allows me to honor and decorate my body as it is, rather than searching for the clothing sanctioned by others. I've taken charge of the beauty standards I hold myself to by making myself this wardrobe which exuberantly breaks all the flattering fashion rules I've been conditioned to obey by society, family and myself.</div>

							1. Streamline With (mono) Color, especially black

						</div>
						<div class='rule-body'>
							"Look taller and trimmer by dressing monochromatically head to toe. "Lose" five pounds by matching your pants or skirt, stockings and shoes. You'll seem 10 pounds lighter if they're all black! Bright colors and prints will call unnecessary attention to your shape and make you look bigger. Is the one-color thing too tame for your taste? Slip on a pair of bright shoes to shake things up." 
						</div>
						<img class='rule-img' src="/images/daisyChainImages/allBlack.png"  alt="">
					</div>
					<div class='good'>
						<div class='rule-title'>
							1. Look Joyful in Bright Colors
						</div>
						<div class='rule-body'>
							For most of my life, I used clothes to hide my body, the only thing that mattered was whether things were flattering. When I started making clothes, I realized they could also be for fun and for decoration. Before I started making clothes I wanted to be camouflaged. Since I've started making clothes I hope people will notice them, so I can say joyfully, "thanks! I made it!"  
						</div>
						<img class='rule-img' src="/images/mendedHeart.jpg"  alt="">

						<div class='rule-title'>2. Go for a midi-length skirt</div>

						<div class='rule-body'>"If your legs are one of your worry zones, you’re in luck! Midi-length skirts are perennially in style, and the combination of extra fabric and a cinch at the waist never fail to flatter your figure. Go for a hemline that hits below the kneecap to make legs look their absolute best."</div>
						<img class='rule-img' src="/images/daisyChainImages/midiSkirt.png"  alt="">
					</div>

					<div class='good'>
						<div class='rule-title'>
							2. Decide what's sexy for yourself
						</div>
						<div class='rule-body'>
							When I was in college I was out to lunch with a man (ahem, dad) and asked him to stop leering at our short skirt-wearing waitress. The man (ahem, dad) retorted, "You're just jealous because you can't wear a skirt like that." Since then, I avoided all things short and tight, knowing if I did I'd look disgusting and be de-sexualized (and supposedly be jealous—not grateful—I'd never be leered at and hyper-sexualized. Quite the double edged sword). I made myself this short skirt as a statement to myself that I don't have to give that gross sexist comment any more power for even one more minute.

							<div class='rule-title'>3. Skin Tight Dresses—Might Not Be A Great Idea</div>
							<div class='rule-source'><a href="https://www.liveabout.com/styles-that-make-women-look-fat-2658614">10 Styles that Make Women Look Fat</a></div>
							<div class='rule-body'>"Wearing a dress that's skin-tight is a big mistake if you want to look thinner and taller. If a dress feels tight, if horizontal wrinkles are appearing (especially across the bust, hips, or thighs), or if lumps and bumps are clearly visible, the dress does not belong in your wardrobe. The too-tight dress effect is likely to be multiplied if the dress also has other unflattering features, such as being too short or too revealing. Certain fabrics can also compound the fattening effect."</div>

								3. Don't give a f*ck in a tight dress
							</div>
							<div class='rule-body'>
								All over Curvy Sewing Collective I see women of all sizes rocking "Wiggle Dresses"—dresses so tight you have to wiggle into them. I thought of wiggle dresses as anathema to curvy dressing before I saw so many women looking so freaking fabulous in them. I decided to go way the hell out of my comfort zone and make on for myself. When I wince at myself in it, I think of how beautiful I think other women look in them and remind myself the problem with my body might just be in my head.

								<div class='rule-body'>"For years mothers have told their daughters that horizontal stripes do the female figure no favors and that vertical ones are more flattering. As a result, many women have spent their lives avoiding horizontal hoops for fear of looking fat." "Val Watham, 53, was unconvinced by research which claimed horizontal stripes flatter the figure. She undertook her own research, dressing models in a variety of striped designs and asking members of the public to rate their appearance. The findings demonstrated that horizontal stripes do make people appear wider, while vertical stripes make people appear taller."</div>

									4. Enjoy all directions of stripes
								</div>
								<div class='rule-body'>
									For years I didn't wear horizontal stripes because my mom (and probably also your mom) said they make me look fat. That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard—as if someone can't tell what I look like when I wear polka dots but my body blows up like a blimp (thanks Mom for the blimp comparison) in stripes. I made myself a whole bunch of fun clothes with horizontal stripes to celebrate saying goodbye to this nonsense fashion rule.

									<div class='rule-body'>"Skinny jeans [and leggings] look best when worn by skinny women. Just because skinny jeans are available in all sizes doesn't mean that they're a flattering style choice.

										5. Be extremely comfortable in leggings as pants
									</div>
									<div class='rule-body'>
										When leggings first started to become pants, I told myself they were only pants for thin women. Dressing for yoga and exercise meant pulling together creative outfits that hid my athleisure under tunics and skirts. I saw women all around me comfy AF in leggings, but that wasn't for me.  I made myself some bold leggings (and some plain ones) that I absolutely love rocking as pants.

											6. Bare your arms
										</div>
										<div class='rule-body'>
											In 6th grade I got this pastel green and yellow tank top I absolutely loved. The first time I wore it outside to play in the front yard with our neighbors my mom looked at me uncomfortably and suggested it would look cute under something with sleeves. I didn't wear a sleeveless top again for more than 10 years. A few years ago I decided I'd had enough and began tentatively showing my arms in my clothes. At first I always brought a just-in-case-I-feel-self-conscious-cardigan with me no matter how hot it was. Now, I'm sick of sweating and passing on cute dresses and tops because they're for someone else's body. Bye bye cardigans in 90 degree heat, hello dinosaur dress!

											<div class='rule-body'>"Clean, streamlined jeans are the way to go. The most flattering styles are dark and feature unembellished pockets. Avoid extra details that catch the eye and give the illusion of bulk-think twice about tags, grommets, or decorative extras. The leanest silhouettes of all: boot cut and straight leg."</div>

											</div>
											<div class='rule-body'>
												When clothes are camouflage, all kids of fun styles are off limits. I've been seeing an explosion of cute jumpsuit styles and thinking they were off limits to me. I've been seeing an explosion of fun floral prints and thinking they were off limits to me. I've been seeing printed and color denims and thinking they were off limits to me. Now I present you with this rocking floral denim jumpsuit.

												<div class='rule-body'>"Layering is another technique that magically hides it all away, shifting the focus anywhere but your tummy. Combinations like the tank top with plaid shirt; knee-length dress and a cape; trousers with a shirt and blazer or shrug etc. work pretty well to your advantage. Layers that are unbuttoned gives it a significant effect making you look taller. Make-believe in the truest sense."</div>

													8. You have nothing to hide
												</div>
												<div class='rule-body'>
													My senior year of high school there was a day when underclassmen in stage crew dressed up  as seniors. The kid who dressed as me wore tons of layers—long sleeve T under short sleeve T, flared jeans under a knee length skirt, a cardigan, and a scarf. I've thought about that a lot since then—it was so transparent how much I was hiding. Now I sometimes just wear one thing!

These soft, comfortable and tight-fitting undergarments come in a lot of variants, taking full control of your tummy area. You can easily get away with those body hugging dresses that were forever part of your wish list. It makes a lot of difference, especially if you make smart choices." </div>

														In high school when my friends went to the beach (an experience I dreaded) I wore shapewear under jeans and said I hated swimming. Years later I found an emerald green suit that fit me and I swam at the beach with friends for the first time. Turns out, the beach is my favorite place! When I saw an online campaign declaring that every body is a bikini body, it was a revelation. Here were women giving claiming the right to define a good enough body. Could it be that all I needed to do to have a good enough body to enjoy the beach was decide my body was good enough to enjoy the beach?  I made myself this emerald bikini as an homage to that emerald one piece from years ago, and the first suit I ever felt comfortable in, but this time with some belly showing.
