As long as there has been craft, there have been challenging, frustrating, and inevitable mistakes. Craftspeople from around the world and throughout history have responded to this by developing cultural and spiritual traditions for making sense of the imperfection and error inherent to their work. 

This [interactive map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=100-0WsK-ZQAdmNg1yAVvRuW4qi9RT4Lc&ll=9.009664116231953%2C0&z=2) is a repository for me to collect examples of these traditions from around the world and how they influence my thinking. As I continue to explore what makes imperfection brilliant, this map will be updated with discoveries of such traditions from around the world. You can email me with ideas to add or correct at [miriam@powderhouse.org](mailto:miriam@powderhouse.org).

The traditions are categorized into 5 themes, and I will be continuing to refine and adjust these themes as I learn more about these traditions, and discover new ones:

- **Life is fragile:** Some traditions, such as the Japanese tradition of Wabi Sabi, honor the fragility of life by emulating it in craft. Rather than pursue the sterility of perfection, craftspeople in these traditions celebrate impermanence and fragility by embellishing it and making it beautiful in their work.
- **Only god Is perfect:** In some traditions, such as Persian Carpet Weaving, it is considered an affront to God for humans to pursue perfection. To respect the rightful place of humans in relationship to God, craftspeople in these traditions leave an intentional flaw in their work.
- **Perfection draws the attention of the evil eye:** In some traditions, including Pulkhari embroidery from India, there is a belief that evil spirits (known in some cultures as the evil eye) are attracted to joy and perfection, and that creating something perfect draws the attention of evil intent on ruining it. To keep the evil eye away, a craftsperson can intentionally blemish their work.
- **Perfection is hubris:** In the Greek myth of Arachne the Weaver, Arachne believes she can weave better than the Goddess Athena. When she exhibits the hubris to strive for perfection in her craft, she is punished by the Gods by being turned to spider. Although it is known to be apocryphal, American quilters spread this idea in the form of a myth that Amish quilters purposefully embed a mistake in every quilt as a sign of humility before God.
- **Perfection is a trap:** In indigenous weaving traditions from the Southwestern United States, weavers intentionally leave a park called a spirit line in baskets and rugs. The spirit line interrupts the perfect symmetry of the pattern to create a pathway for the spirit of the weaver to exit the piece. The spirit line speaks to the idea that if the piece were completed perfectly, the spirit of the weaver would be trapped, and she would be unable to move on to her next piece.

So far, I find that the fact that at least some of these traditions are apocryphal is the most moving thing about it. To me, it speaks to the idea that to err is human, and to be frustrated about it is human too. So, throughout history we see humans trying to make meaning out of imperfection through storytelling. See that backwards quilt block, it has a story to tell about humility before god. See that patched hole in that jacket, it's there to remind of the preciousness of life. Even if the original crafter may have just put the block on backwards, modern makers crave meaning, and retroactively tell the story that it was there by design. If to err is human, so it seems, is to try to ascribe meaning to our errors. 

About the process:

<details><summary>üß†Insights and Ideas</summary>
	<ul>
		<li>Some of these ideas seem to be romanticized, mythical or apocryphal. I wonder what led to these narratives and why more modern people felt the urge to assign this meanings to the imperfections in others‚Äô craft.</li>
		<li>I‚Äôm having some thoughts and questions about what good, rigorous research and sourcing looks like at PHS. I am using wikipedia, blog posts, and small museums and galleries as well as scholarly work to find information. I wonder about our best practices for evaluating the reliability of sources.</li>
		<li>Appropriation: It feels a little icky to distill big, meaningful traditions into 4 sentences based on teeny bits of research. I am thinking I‚Äôd like to find primary sources about these practices because many seem to be poorly documented and have significant variations an disagreements across sources. I think the closer I can get to primary sources, the more I can trust I am authentically capturing these practices in a way that honors the craftspeople who practice them.</li>
		<li>Learning about these traditions, and connecting to them to ideas that are personally more local to me made things come alive a lot. I felt closer to Pulkhari because I have my own relationship to "the evil eye‚Äù as a concept for example.</li>
		<li>There‚Äôs so much history to learn. Even looking through this teeny tiny lens I learned a lot of tidbits about different cultures and historical eras, and also surprising connections of ideas appearing in different parts of the world. I‚Äôm curious about the role of time, and what historical events led to the evolution of these ideas. For example, why did the myth about Amish Quilters emerge in 1948? Why was the era of Japanese arts that led to Wabi Sabi so distinct? What cultural influences were happening in Japan at that time? There was a Chinese influence in the story of Kintsugi, given the little I know about the strained relationship between China and Japan I‚Äôm curious about that.</li>

<details><summary>üòÄWhat's good about this project</summary>
    <ul>
    	<li>I liked being in a more academic zone, and trying to gather information and learn new facts.</li>
    	<li>It was a good stretch to focus on content before form, even though I didn‚Äôt love it (see below)</li>
    	<li>I liked getting to jump out of my project and work with Rosalie. It helped me feel more connected to the bigger why of the work, and also gave me a chance to get a bit more excited about making my own thing.</li>
	</ul>
</details>

<details><summary>üôÅWhat is not good about this project</summary>
	<ul>
    	<li>I think I don‚Äôt do as well when I don‚Äôt have a form I‚Äôm excited about to hang stuff on. Google maps was inherently less exciting than a DIY visualization, and it was much harder fo fit to feel like real work as a result</li>
    	<li>It‚Äôs hard to do work when your body feels terrible</li>
    	<li>It's impossible to be done‚Äîpeople make whole academic research careers researching just one of these traditions</li>
    </ul>
