This is a collection of writing by Autistic people about Autistic experience, and a very compelling critique of many of the narratives that on their face are supposed to be supportive to Autistic people. Reading it shook up my perspective a ton, and challenged me very deeply to examine my own relationships and practice. As someone who has been in personal and professional relationships with Autistic folks since childhood I find this book is enraging and upsetting and also super powerful and great, but it’s not always clear to me how this book lands with people who don’t have as much personal experience with Autism. </span><a href="https://www.autreat.com/dont_mourn.html" style="font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Don’t Mourn For Us</a><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;;"> is the piece from Loud Hands I’d recommend most strongly if you don’t have time for the whole book.</span></font></div></li><li><div><font color="#333333"><a href="http://stevesilberman.com/book/neurotribes/" style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Neuro Tribes</a><span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;;">, by Steve Silberman. This is a history of Autism and Autistic people that in addition to being a pretty amazing and deep history, examines how we socially construct what normal means. I went into this book expecting it to be a review for me, and it ended up completely rocking my perspective. Unlike with Loud Hands, I have heard from people who are not especially familiar with Autism that it is fascinating.</span></font></div></li><li><div><font color="#333333"><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-meets-disability" style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Design Meets Disability</a><span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;;">, by Graham Pulllin. This book was really special to me in college, when I was the only person in my program specifically interested in the intersection of design and disability. It explores the benefit to design of considering disability and the benefit fro disabled people of good design. I haven’t revisited it in years, but I think it’s probably still great. I don’t know that it is super political in its analysis of disability, I wouldn’t have picked up on that when I read it.</span></font></div></li><li><div><font color="#333333"><a href="http://andrewsolomon.com/books/far-from-the-tree/" style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Far From the Tree</a><span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;;">, by Andrew Solomon. I think this is an unkind book to recommend because it is absurdly long and broad in scope, and feels like a collection of about 14 books. That said, I found several sections of it, particularly (surprise) the disability sections, to be really amazing. Solomon is looking at identities that are usually not shared between generations (sexuality, disability) vs. identities that are usually shared (race, religion). He gives a historical and political framing of each identity and weaves in stories of parents and children. The section on what he calls "Multiple Severe Disabilities" was one of the most influential things I’ve read that reflects some of the issues that challenge me most with folks I work with at Perkins.</span></font></div></li><li><div><font color="#333333"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006XWYBO0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Play Therapy</a><span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;;">, by Virginia Axline.
