Until I asked that question, I didn’t understand what I was doing: What I’m doing here is looking for a golden thread that when woven through these emails and texts turns them from hurtful chaos into something meaningful. I am digging into these emails out of the hope (or superstition) that if I can make something beautiful out of them, or dig up some pattern in them, I can give them a handle by which they can be carried. I’m mixing metaphors here, trying to tie the stoic Epictetus's handles to the Kintsugi golden scar. It seems to me they are connected by the deeply human wish for the broken and imperfect to be given meaning. Is meaning making “the handle by which it (the hard and heavy stuff of life) can be carried?” </div></body></html>
