<div>There’s a thing Joan Didion said about grieving a bay that died, and how that baby will always be perfect because it never had time to disappoint her. I am interested in that idea, and what it might mean about perfection—namely that it’s completely imaginary, and every moment of being a human being is about falling further away from it. </div>
