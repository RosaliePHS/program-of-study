title: The Joan Didion thing about the idea baby vs the real baby

<div>There&#x2019;s a thing Joan Didion said about grieving a bay that died, and how that baby will always be perfect because it never had time to disappoint her. I am interested in that idea, and what it might mean about perfection&#x2014;namely that it&#x2019;s completely imaginary, and every moment of being a human being is about falling further away from it.&#xA0;</div>
