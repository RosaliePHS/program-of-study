<div>Here are notes I took (they are just quick jotting snow, but I hope to expand them into a more digestible form) when I asked the team to riff on "What makes imperfection brilliant?” </div>
<ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <div>Emphasize practice over proving</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>Is the point that the thing is actually not imperfect because imperfection is actually good, or that imperfections can be accepted</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>Imperfection buys into perfection. Different to accommodate weakness vs. not see it as weakness</div>

  </li>
  <li>

    <div>Different words for imperfection, spending time with those words. It’s a good word bank.</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>The world that is given, being unruly is a choice about how to engage</div>
  </li>
