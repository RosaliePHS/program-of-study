<div>Why I like Evernote (i.e. what I would need to be able to do with something else if I were to switch)&#xA0;</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>Phone, iPad and computer apps for writing notes mean you can post from any device easily</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>The web clipper is nice for making good looking posts out of stuff found online</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>The notebooks look nice within the evernote app/the private view looks nice and is user friendly, not just the public view</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>Exporting notebooks into html snippets is easy</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>Tags</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div><br></div>
<div>Concerns about Evernote:</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>Their public publishing looks terrible&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>It isn&#x2019;t free, why pay for a thing when we can build things?&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>People freaked out when they changed their pricing, and a lot of people seem to abandoning it. Is it doomed?&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>I like the idea of building my own thing&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>Inside of Evernote it is not easy to sort by Tags&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div><br></div>
<div>Alternatives to Evernote:</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div><a href="https://joplin.cozic.net/">Joplin</a> seems to be an open source thing designed to be an alternative to Evernote&#xA0;<a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/12/joplin-open-source-evernote-alternative">https://opensource.com/article/17/12/joplin-open-source-evernote-alternative</a></div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>I used to love tumblr for this kind of thing, is that even still a thing?&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>I bet there&#x2019;s an easy enough way to email posts to a Jekyll site if I want to build my own thing and still be able to work on posts from my phone or iPad&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>Tools I can use to build a website with it if I want to keep using Evernote to journal:</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div><a href="https://evernote.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-creating-blog-posts/">This is a guide</a> to evernote best practices for blogging&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>Things GitHub other people made to integrate Jekyll and Evernote:</div>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div><a href="https://github.com/chiepomme/chienote">https://github.com/chiepomme/chienote</a><span>--this looks promising, but I don&#x2019;t completely understand how to set it up.&#xA0;</span></div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div><a href="https://github.com/fooforge/jekyll-evernote_rss">https://github.com/fooforge/jekyll-evernote_rss</a>--this one warns that it&#x2019;s buggy and limited in features</div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <div><a href="https://postach.io/">Postach.io</a>: Made just for this, really simple to set up. BUT the templates they have are really ugly, and you have to pay up to even see what customization is available.&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div><a href="https://dev.evernote.com/doc/">Evernote has an API</a>, so theoretically I should be able to do whatever I want from scratch</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>I bet that I could use the feature of evernote that exports each note as HTML with a resources folder to build up a site using jekyll?&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>There are Wordpress plug ins for this&#xA0;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/evernote-sync/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/evernote-sync/</a>&#xA0;<a href="http://joshpalmeri.com/blog/2017/04/07/evernote-as-a-cms-oh-yes/">http://joshpalmeri.com/blog/2017/04/07/evernote-as-a-cms-oh-yes/</a></div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div><br></div>
<div><span>TLDR: </span>Basically, if I decide to stick with Evernote, I should be able to use Jekyll or Wordpress to build up a site from it pretty easily. If I don&#x2019;t stick with Evernote it&#x2019;s because I can be convinced of a DIY platform that would be comparably easy to post to from multiple devices&#xA0;</div>
