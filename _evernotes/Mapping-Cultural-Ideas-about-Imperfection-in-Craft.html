<div>Reflections and Ideas:&#xA0;</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>Some of these ideas seem to be romanticized, mythical or apocryphal. I wonder what led to these narratives and why more modern people felt the urge to assign this meanings to the imperfections in others&#x2019; craft.&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>I&#x2019;m having some thoughts and questions about what good, rigorous research and sourcing looks like at PHS. I am using wikipedia, blog posts, and small museums and galleries as well as scholarly work to find information. I wonder about our best practices for evaluating the reliability of sources.</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>Appropriation: It feels a little icky to distill big, meaningful traditions into 4 sentences based on teeny bits of research. I am thinking I&#x2019;d like to find primary sources about these practices because many seem to be poorly documented and have significant variations an disagreements across sources. I think the closer I can get to primary sources, the more I can trust I am authentically capturing these practices in a way that honors the craftspeople who practice them.&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>Learning about these traditions, and connecting to them to ideas that are personally more local to me made things come alive a lot. I felt closer to Pulkhari because I have my own relationship to &quot;the evil eye&#x201D; as a concept for example.&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>There&#x2019;s so much history to learn. Even looking through this teeny tiny lens I learned a lot of tidbits about different cultures and historical eras, and also surprising connections of ideas appearing in different parts of the world. I&#x2019;m curious about the role of time, and what historical events led to the evolution of these ideas. For example, why did the myth about Amish Quilters emerge in 1948? Why was the era of Japanese arts that led to Wabi Sabi so distinct? What cultural influences were happening in Japan at that time? There was a Chinese influence in the story of Kintsugi, given the little I know about the strained relationship between China and Japan I&#x2019;m curious about that.&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div><br></div>
<div>Pluses:</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>I liked being in a more academic zone, and trying to gather information and learn new facts.&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>It was a good stretch to focus on content before form, even though I didn&#x2019;t love it (see below)</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>I liked getting to jump out of my project and work with Rosalie. It helped me feel more connected to the bigger why of the work, and also gave me a chance to get a bit more excited about making my own thing.&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div><br></div>
<div>Deltas:</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>I think I don&#x2019;t do as well when I don&#x2019;t have a form I&#x2019;m excited about to hang stuff on. Google maps was inherently less exciting than a DIY visualization, and it was much harder fo fit to feel like real work as a result</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>It&#x2019;s hard to do work when your body feels terrible&#xA0;</div>
  </li>
</ul>
