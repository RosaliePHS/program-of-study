title: 'Learning to Embroider: Mistakes are Anticipated'
---
<div>I decided to try an embroidery sampler to give myself a chance to try different stitches. When doing something new, mistakes are inevitable. Here I will document learning how to do this new thing, and in what ways it does not go smoothly.&#xA0;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Step 1: trying to get the right colors for each stitch</div>
<div><br></div>

<div>First mistake: on my very first backstitch I snagged the entire thread into a big knot. It was annoying! Untangling knots always brings me back to the orange couch in my childhood den, untying Aaron&#x2019;s show laces while he watches basketball. He&#x2019;s 9, I&#x2019;m 11. He&#x2019;s outgrown all the Velcro shoes but still can&#x2019;t tie his laces, so he just ties them into double and triple and quadruple knots all day. Every night while we watch TV I unsnarl them and get them ready for tomorrow, when he&#x2019;ll hide under his desk and cover his ears to block out mean words. This is one small way I can help. I don&#x2019;t remember how many times I did this, but I can&#x2019;t unsnag a knotted string without remembering it.&#xA0;</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>Mistake 2: I used the same color thread a second time! I considered pulling it out and redoing the first stripe, but decided it would be more in the spirit of the thing to leave it.&#xA0;</div>
<div><img src="{{ site.evernote_media_export_path }}/IMG_0454.jpg" height="4032" width="3024"><br></div>

<div>This is the moment when I felt like I got how the coral stitch worked enough to do it repeatably</div>
<div><img src="{{ site.evernote_media_export_path }}/IMG_0455.jpg" height="4032" width="3024"><br></div>
<div>Before this the stitches are really uneven, and not all the knots are the same style. After this I understood it.&#xA0;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Algerian eyes and herringbone went relatively smoothly! It&#x2019;s so noticeable how much easier it feels when it&#x2019;s, well, easy.&#xA0;</div>
<div><br></div>

<div>Getting ready for satin stitch I paused to consider whether to look up directions or guess. Seems like with directions I&#x2019;m likely to get a better result, but some part of itches to just do it. I&#x2019;m going to go with directions, because that seems like what a person who wasn&#x2019;t rushing and was trying to understand deeply would do. Of course, when I looked it up it was exactly as simple as I predicted.&#xA0;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><img src="{{ site.evernote_media_export_path }}/IMG_0465.PNG" height="1334" width="750"><br></div>
<div>I told myself I was just going to do enough of this to learn each stitch and see how it looks. But, now I see that I really don&#x2019;t want to leave part of the section unfinished. It&#x2019;s slightly painful to think of just moving on as is, but completing it when I&#x2019;ve clearly learned the stitch seems to defeat the purpose. I think I might compromise by trying to do one more circle in a way that helps it feel more composed.&#xA0;</div>

<div>Sitting here, at work, learning to embroider and listening to music, Rosalie brings me a hot chocolate. I can&#x2019;t exaplain it, but this moment overcomes me with a gratitude so warm and tender I nearly cry. How can anything be as perfect as this life I find myself living?&#xA0;</div>
<div>&#xA0;</div>
<div>A mistake! I can&#x2019;t figure out how this stitch is different, except it clearly is.&#xA0;</div>
<div><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div>Daisy chain is hard! That doesn&#x2019;t look like a daisy at all!&#xA0;</div>
<div><img src="{{ site.evernote_media_export_path }}/IMG_0472.jpg" height="4032" width="3024"><br></div>
<div><img src="{{ site.evernote_media_export_path }}/IMG_0471.jpg" height="4032" width="3024"><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Working on the French knots I kept running into difficulty in the same way. The thread snags up and knots too soon, then can&#x2019;t pull through. Annoyingly, the very last one I did was the most messed up. It&#x2019;s a hard decision whether to take it out or fix it.&#xA0;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I&#x2019;m deciding to fix it because I am super annoyed by it, and it should be an easy thing to just pull out. Even though this sample doesn&#x2019;t matter at all it&#x2019;s really hard for me to leave a mistake that eye catching.&#xA0;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>And, because <a dir="ltr">10pm</a> is too late to learn anything new, and this chain stitch looks like crap, I&#x2019;m going to bed.&#xA0;</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>Timing really is everything! I came back to this at a more reasonable time, and it was immediately obvious to me how the stitch works. It took 30 seconds to get my head around it and get a good row of stitches going.&#xA0;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Once I had the hang of chain stitch I decided to declare the sampler finished enough. My goal was to get exposed to a bunch of options for stitches, and I did.&#xA0;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Finished enough:</div>

<div><br></div>
<div>While in general I like the idea of learning through the projects I do, sometimes screwing up something I care about because I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m doing sucks. It was nice to take this on just to learn, and not to have to care about mistakes at all. When I design embroidery projects in the future I think I&#x2019;ll feel more confident because I took the time to try out the skills on a throwaway project first.&#xA0;</div>
