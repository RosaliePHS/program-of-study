<div><span>&#x201C;</span><span>Everything has two handles: one by which it may be carried, the other by which it can&#x2019;t be carried.&#x201D;&#xA0;</span></div>

<div>When I got the timeline with tags implemented, and stepped back to look at it, I expected to see a pattern. When there appeared to be nothing more than a random smattering of dots I had 2 simultaneous thoughts: 1) I guess I&#x2019;ll have to keep building more to find the pattern.&#xA0;2) What if there is no pattern here?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I think that when I asked, &#x201C;What if there is no pattern?&#x201D; I was really asking, &#x201C;What if there is no meaning to be made here?&#x201D; This is pointing at why this project is meaningful to me, and what it has to do with Brilliant Imperfection. Until I asked that question, I didn&#x2019;t understand what I was doing: What I&#x2019;m doing here is looking for a golden thread that when woven through these emails and texts turns them from hurtful chaos into something meaningful. I am digging into these emails out of the hope (or superstition) that if I can make something beautiful out of them, or dig up some pattern in them, I can give them a handle by which they can be carried. I&#x2019;m mixing metaphors here, trying to tie the stoic Epictetus&apos;s handles to the Kintsugi golden scar. It seems to me they are connected by the deeply human wish for the broken and imperfect to be given meaning. Is meaning making &#x201C;the handle by which it (the hard and heavy stuff of life) can be carried?&#x201D;&#xA0;</div>
