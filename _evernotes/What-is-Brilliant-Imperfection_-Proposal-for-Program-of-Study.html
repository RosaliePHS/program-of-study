<div><span>I&#x2019;ve </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QjjHxJdltxPAAp0hx2WtGhTV_07wBtrm3efcbfzc-60/edit?usp=sharing">framed my Program of Study</a><span> as&#xA0;&#x201C;Brilliant Imperfection&#x201D; borrowing the title from </span><a href="https://eliclare.com/books/brilliant-imperfection">this book by Eli Clare</a><span>. I</span><span>&#x2019;</span><span>m interested in exploring why it is (because I think it is true, but don&#x2019;t know/feel deeply why and how) that</span><span>&#xA0;imperfection (and it</span><span>&#x2019;</span><span>s cousins&#xA0;</span><span>deviation, weirdness, variation, complexity, disorder, strangeness, etc.)</span><span>&#xA0;seems to be the locus of the best, most beautiful, and most meaningful aspects of human experience. It seems to me that while nature seems to thrive through variation and diversity, humans have spent much of our history building systems (see: capitalism) that reward sameness and alienate individuals from our uniqueness.&#xA0;</span><br></div>
