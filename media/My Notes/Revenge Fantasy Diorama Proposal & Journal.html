Not my proudest moment, but I think I would draw tremendous joy from a model/music box/diorama of that particular revenge fantasy. </div><div><br/></div><div>On a deeper level, being angry at my mom has always felt kind of taboo, and I don’t actually go there that easily. I can describe outrageous things she’s done, and say I’m outraged, but really feeling anger still feels risky. However, when her boyfriend sent me a letter I was a fireball of rage for days. All the anger I couldn’t quite feel for her was very easy to direct at him. There’s something that I think would be useful to me about returning to that anger and spending a little time there. In this case, the project would largely be about forcing me to sit in that angry place for a while. I also think there’s a kernel in here about a therapeutic activity city that would be amazing to do with other people—although it would be extremely risky to do with youth—of identifying and modeling revenge fantasies in a way that helps people release and move on from anger. </div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">What will you wind up with?</span></div><div>I will end up with something in the spirit of a ballerina music box, which has room in it to hold the letter from Brian and the note I drafted in response. It will have a moving element with a jeep rolling back and forth over a bed of flowers. </div><div><br/></div><div>In addition to making my revenge fantasy, I also want to make one for my roommate, who has a rich and illustrative revenge fantasy of her own.  </div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">What's an inspiring peer?</span></div><div>I truly have no idea. </div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">How will you do it? </span></div><div>I am picturing that I can use a cigar box and make a mechanism where opening and closing it causes a matchbox jeep to move (or use the guts of a ballerina music box). I will likely use either fake flowers or make sculpted flowers for the garden. Inside the box I’ll put the letter from Brian. I might decoupage my note into the box so you see it when you open the lid, or put mine in an envelope alongside his.</div><div><br/></div><div>Reflections</div><ul><li><div>I continue to find myself compelled to work on this, and can’t seem to stop</div></li><li><div>Let’s talk about why the envelope is cut up like this. The letter fits in the box, but the envelop doesn’t. I thought I could put the letter in expose but then when I look at it I’m filled with such incandescant fucking rage that I actually need it in the envelope to not murder anyone. So, I cut up and shrink the envelope. </div><div><br/></div><div><img src="Revenge%20Fantasy%20Diorama%20Proposal%20&amp;%20Journal.html.resources/IMG_0571.JPG" height="4224" width="2376"/></div></li></ul><div><br/></div><ul><li><div>Whoa. Making the scene felt AMAZING. I was itching to work on it for the last few days, and I thought it was just “project mode” but once I started to do it I felt this intense focus and even though it was just a little diorama scene inhabiting the experience of driving a jeep around and destroying that garden felt great. I felt like I’d had a workout when I was done, and then that post exercise bliss feeling where you’re relaxed enough to just drift to sleep. I am honestly so surprised how real it felt. I am clearly holding some rage about that letter and that fucking garden. I kept thinking about the idea of incandescent rage—that it courses through you and lights you up and it’s kind of exhilarating. All week I’ve been able to get angry at everyone about everything but it felt kind of hollow. It is extremely rare for me to live in the angry space about my mom, it feels dangerous somehow. But, doing this and living in it even just for a couple of hours, with permission for anger—not grief, not sadness, not nuance--just anger was some strong fucking medicine. </div></li></ul><div><img src="Revenge%20Fantasy%20Diorama%20Proposal%20&amp;%20Journal.html.resources/IMG_0572.jpg" height="3024" width="4032"/><br/></div><div><img src="Revenge%20Fantasy%20Diorama%20Proposal%20&amp;%20Journal.html.resources/IMG_0573.jpg" height="3024" width="4032"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Today I was walking up the stairs and I noticed it was loud, like I do every time. But this time I thought about a time when I was young and my mom said it sounded like a stomping elephant upstairs or something like that. I don’t think I’ve ever walked stairs without worrying if i make a sound since then. I wonder if today I could remember that because of this project, and if it serves me to remember it. </div><div><br/></div><div>Here are Shaunalynn’s notes from the critique: </div><div><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Will people actually play the game?
