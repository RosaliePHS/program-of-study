The overall goal in trauma therapy is to give the child control of the experience—how and when to talk about it, how to tell the story, and what it means. The narrative is the child's opportunity to decide and share the meaning they have made and demonstrate control. I think this process is aligned with that.</div></li><li><div>Control over narrative—making editorial choices, deciding how to frame things </div></li></ul><li><div>Audience and Validation</div></li><ul><li><div>I did not factor in the impact of audience until working on this piece. Feeling that others can share my experience, and that it can be legible, allows for validation I did not anticipate, nor know I was craving.</div></li></ul><li><div>Wish/fear (the dialectic) </div></li><ul><li><div>As much as I crave the validation, exposing this content comes with overwhelming risk both that others will see it and take from it that the negative content about me is true, or that their empathy and validation will open up more grief than I can tolerate.</div></li></ul><li><div>Humor as a defense</div></li><ul><li><div>[The Splitting book] is not funny. Many of my ideas for this project use humor, but not this one. I suspect this one will therefore be the hardest to discuss. How and when to deploy humor is itself a really I retesting therapeutic question to me.</div></li><li><div>I thought about this with the accordion book because it wasn't funny, and it was reinforced with [the etch a sketch] because it is a joke, and it was much easier to work on.</div></li></ul><li><div>Slowness, exposure, and dosing</div></li><ul><li><div>I knew that spending time swimming around in these messages would be moving, enraging, and sad. There's no substitute for time in that case, whole days cutting and gluing pages require slow, careful exposure to the content. I can look at it sideways, reading it over and over as it loses its potency, all while slightly distracted from the messages' intensity by the technical processes of making.</div></li><li><div>This [etch a sketch] is a really different exposure than the splitting book. With this, when other people interact with it I have no control over what messages they see. That is way higher up the fear ladder/exposure hierarchy than the curated form of the splitting book. If I consider this piece as having an audience outside of me, then I have to tolerate the idea that other people could see any message. One of the feelings I feel about these messages on the whole is shame, that they reflect poorly on me either because they are true, or because they expose shameful things about me and my family. The feeling of choosing to allow others to see them, and relinquishing control of which specific messages they see, seems to be forcing me to consider whether they do in fact reflect badly on me. If they do, I wouldn't want to let anyone shake the etch a sketch without curating the selection of messages. If I do let other people do it, I'm giving myself the message that the material is not too shameful to be shared. That feels like a powerful thing.</div></li></ul><li><div>Problem solving</div></li><ul><li><div>This project was much more doing than reflecting, and the kind of thinking I was doing was much more about tangible problem solving and much less about ideas. It was a lot easier to get lost and distracted in it.</div></li></ul><li><div>Approaching material that wounds sense of self-worth from a place of competence</div></li><ol><li><div>Because I am so comfortable with craft, I can feel powerful and competent as I work with his content. Probably, the capacity to create high quality, high production value artifacts is a necessary ingredient for doing this kind of thing and having it work emotionally the way I want it to </div></li></ol><li><div>Evidence and proof—using the “cold hard facts” to tell the story, knowing I am telling the truth, feeling like I have proof of being decent and right  </div></li><li><div>Shifting and deepening my knowledge of what I think I want—going from wanting to game to evoke how it feels, to wanting to play the mom role, to wanting someone else to validate that there are no cards left to play and to see how hard I tried </div></li><li><div>I usually think of myself as being overly sensitive. Living in this material makes it easier for me to access that the things that are hard for me come from somewhere. </div></li><li><div>I’m more aware of moments in daily life I’m responding to differently because I’m working on this. I might not have noticed how I hold back from being angry when anger is risky if I weren’t in this project. I caught myself soothing people I'm mad at several times this week. I don’t think I would have noticed that without this project. Now that I’ve noticed it I can make a choice about when and whether to do it that I couldn’t have made before. </div></li><li><div>I’m dreaming about my mom a lot these days. The dreams are clearly growing out of the projects. WTF is that about?  </div></li><li><div>Limited access to avoidance because the thing needs to get done</div></li></ul><div><br/></div></body></html>
