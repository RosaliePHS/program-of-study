Not my proudest moment, but I think I would draw tremendous joy from a model/music box/diorama of that particular revenge fantasy.</div></li><li><div><a href="https://www.socialthinking.com/Products/Superflex%20Unthinkables%20Poster">Unthinkables</a> style characters of the strategy codes used in the emails (enrolling, gaslighting, erasing, etc). Also, the Unthinkables are a riff on action and superhero villains, so I could riff on that directly as well.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-style: italic;">T shirt with Volcano Tour company logo and “my responses to stress are proportional and appropriate”:</span> My roommate and I have a very overused joke about taking a one-way mother daughter trip to the edge of an active volcano. I think actually making the t-shirt we always joke about (with the above quote from my mom on the back) would be quite fun.</div></li><li><div>Strategy card game: I'd like to create a board game or card game to capture how the relationship feels, probably based on the strategy codes as well. The rough idea would be a game where one person is playing a complicated and convoluted strategy game and the other person is just randomly flipping over cards.</div></li><li><div>Magnetic poetry: It just feels kind of right to make a magnetic poetry set using language from the emails. There's something about the way she uses phrases and ideas over and over that lends itself to creating absurdist poetry using her words.</div></li><li><div>Gaslighting: One very robust set of messages is messages that use gaslighting. This term has gotten a lot of usage since 2016, and it's overused a lot. I think it would be interesting to me to research the history of that term, develop a definition that works for me, and use messages from my mom to illustrate it. I like the idea of doing a poster or info graphic as the form, because of this impulse I have to correct people who use the term wrong.</div></li><li><div>Chapter book: I think a print book of the emails makes sense to make. It's so dense I think it could be interesting to break it out into a chapter book of sorts where each new phase or major milestone is the start of a chapter, and create illustrated divider pages for each.</div></li><li><div>Transcript thing: Use the visual language of the deposition transcripts to build a “case” that my mom wanted me to read the depositions </div></li><li>Replace the art in my room?</li><li><div>Graphic novel treatment of Palm Springs incident</div></li><li><div>Do something with the challah recipe</div></li></ul><div><br/></div></body></html>
