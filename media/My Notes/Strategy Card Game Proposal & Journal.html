She’ll say and do just about anything if she thinks it has a chance of getting my attention, and she switches approach quickly as she exhausts her options. </div><div><br/></div><div>I also saw in my responses to her that I have a set of strategies too, and I lose my composure and say impulsive and unkind things occasionally too. Almost always, I took time, asked other people for advice, composed messages painstakingly, analyzed when was the right time of day to send them, how long to wait, who to run them by before hitting send. I kept drafts for hours before sending, just in case I changed my mind. </div><div><br/></div><div>While she and I are both using strategies, the way we play is extremely different. Where I was careful, cautious, and  strategic she was impulsive and emotional. Eventually, coming to the decision to cut off communication was largely realizing we weren’t playing the same game, and I was never going to be able to ask her to play by my rules, any more than I was willing to play by hers. </div><div><br/></div><div>As I read through the emails I created a set of qualitative codes to organize the strategies I noticed her using. The strategies I identified are:</div><ul><li><div>Worrying :Times when she claims to be worried about me or someone else to get me to communicate</div></li><li><div>Enrolling: when she tries to give me information I don’t want, or to rope me in to a problem or crisis</div></li><li><div>Pleading: persistently asking me to call, text, visit, etc.</div></li><li><div>Erasing: Pretending something hasn’t happened, or changing her position without acknowledgement</div></li><li><div>Distracting: changing the subject, random articles, requests to visit out of nowhere</div></li><li><div>Repairing: more reasonable apology type emails</div></li><li><div>Threatening: threatening to move on without me in her life, to cut off communication, to cut off the phone plan, etc.</div></li><li><div>Gaslighting: Accusing me of narcissism, of making others unhappy because I am unhappy</div></li><li><div>Accusing: Saying mean things, scolding or reprimanding, blaming</div></li><li><div>Rationalizing: Explaining how her responses are reasonable under the circumstances"</div></li><li><div>Self-glorifying: Talking about how she is the kindest, best person, so fun and funny, so wise, etc.</div></li><li><div>Invalidating: Saying something isn't a problem because it doesn't bother her, telling me to just get over it</div></li></ul><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">What will you wind up with?</span></div><div>I'd like to create a board game or card game to capture how the relationship feels based on the strategy codes. The rough idea would be a game where one person is playing a complicated and convoluted strategy game (me) and the other person is just randomly flipping over cards (her). </div><ul><li><div>The experience of the player playing me: They have the task of composing a message, and are going through complicated, multi-step, strategic processes involving asking friends for help, waiting for replies, waiting for random amounts of time to cool down, writing certain numbers of drafts, etc. I think they should not actually be composing a message by writing, but somehow collecting the pieces they need in card form or something</div></li><li><div>The experience of the player playing my mom: They get a deck of cards, shuffle it, set it down and no matter what the player being me does they just turn over the next card as their response. </div></li></ul><div>I think the demo of this should be me playing as my mom and getting to experience other people playing as me. </div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">What's an inspiring peer?</span> </div><div>I’m thinking about the genre of board games, and although I don’t actually intend to create a play-able game (the whole idea is that it is not playable, because the 2 players are playing different games) I think it will be most effective if it successfully borrows the visual language and mechanics of real games. </div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-style: italic;">How will you do it?</span> </div><ul><li><div>I’m going to start by creating a draft of my “mom’s" card deck, because I know more or less what I want that to be and what I want “her” to be doing</div></li><li><div>Next I will play with prototypes of my deck and instructions, and review other games for ideas about how to create the game mechanics, visual language and instructions</div></li><li><div>Alongside this, I am considering going through the emails and coding my strategies, because I think using real text from my messages to her could be interesting. </div></li></ul><div><br/></div><div>Reflections</div><ul><li><div>It was December 2016–3 years in, in the ODST of the Palm Springs incident—before I sent my first angry reactive message. It is nearly impossible for me to believe this true fact about my own behavior without evidence. It’s sort of a revelation to see this</div></li><li><div>The choice to frame asking for things as yearning instead of greed—getting to choose my narrative</div></li><li><div>I realized I could have printed the mom emails in order so I wouldn’t have to sort them and count them, but that’s another time to read and absorb them. Exposure. </div></li><li><div><img src="Strategy%20Card%20Game%20Proposal%20&amp;%20Journal.html.resources/IMG_0563.jpg" height="4032" width="3024"/></div></li><li><div>notable: I don’t like writing “mom’s” or “my mom’s” and “the emails” is easier</div></li><li><div>What does accuracy mean? Should the ratio of types of emails be accurate, or how it felt?</div></li><li><div>I think the numbers of each type of message might be surprising. </div></li><li><div>I’m getting ANGRY. The “what LA thing?” Motif is enraging. </div></li><li><div>Decided to stay with the counting and histogram of types of email because it feels really important. There’s something really alluring about numbers. They feel like facts even though I’m already undermining them by reminding myself I assigned the values and made the categories and chose what to count and how to frame them so they’re not objective. I’m wondering why I want to see the facts and am also resisting them at the same time. I think the one way valve idea is important here. There are doors you can’t walk back through </div></li><li><div>I wonder what it means that I undercounted gaslighting, or that my definition shifted such that I moved 6 messages from accusing to gaslighting. FascinAtingly there are also a bunch I used for the splitting book that aren’t here. Went from 20 to 32. </div></li><ul><li><div>Is it true in my life that I’m more susceptible to this tactic than any other?</div></li><li><div>In what ways is this project making it less true?</div></li></ul><li><div> A specific email popped up that I think I really wouldn’t want to share with colleagues. I’m especially irritated and upset by this one. I find myself wa ting to set it aside and do something with it or otherwise flag it </div><div><img src="Strategy%20Card%20Game%20Proposal%20&amp;%20Journal.html.resources/IMG_0566.JPG" height="4224" width="2376"/></div></li><li><div>Why do I want to play moM?</div></li><ul><li><div>Being in the position of the person who doesn’t get hurt</div></li><li><div>Wanting to inflict the feelings as a bid for empathy</div></li><li><div>Revenge</div></li><li><div>Wanting to understand how she feels about me </div></li></ul><li><div>Framing asking for things as “yearning” instead of “greed” or “materialism” or “manipulating” </div></li><ul><li><div>I get to decide the narrative, it gets to be a kind narrative to me</div></li><li><div>Deciding how I want to feel even if I'm not totally there yet is a step towards internalizing a change </div></li></ul><li><div>What is my relationship to facts? I preserved ratios between types of emails, but got to edit which to include. </div></li><li><div>On my side I chose not to use direct quotes for all of them. And to sometimes say why I said or did something</div></li><li><div>Choosing to leave out the repairing cards? They’re so confusing. </div></li><li><div>Wanting to avoid but not being done. I’m done with it but it’s not done with me. </div></li><li><div>I’ve been anxious—is it project brain in general or about the content?</div></li><li><div>One of the questions embedded in this is “what would you write back to that?” I think there’s some validation in seeking in seeing that other people might see these messages and think they wouldn’t know how to reply either </div></li></ul><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
