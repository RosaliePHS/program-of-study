When doing something new, mistakes are inevitable. Here I will document learning how to do this new thing, and in what ways it does not go smoothly. </div><div><br/></div><div>Step 1: trying to get the right colors for each stitch</div><div><br/></div><div><img src="Learning%20to%20Embroider%3A%20Mistakes%20are%20Anticipated.html.resources/IMG_0451.jpg" height="4032" width="3024"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>First mistake: on my very first backstitch I snagged the entire thread into a big knot. It was annoying! Untangling knots always brings me back to the orange couch in my childhood den, untying Aaron’s show laces while he watches basketball. He’s 9, I’m 11. He’s outgrown all the Velcro shoes but still can’t tie his laces, so he just ties them into double and triple and quadruple knots all day. Every night while we watch TV I unsnarl them and get them ready for tomorrow, when he’ll hide under his desk and cover his ears to block out mean words. This is one small way I can help. I don’t remember how many times I did this, but I can’t unsnag a knotted string without remembering it. </div><div><img src="Learning%20to%20Embroider%3A%20Mistakes%20are%20Anticipated.html.resources/IMG_0452.jpg" height="4032" width="3024"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Mistake 2: I used the same color thread a second time! I considered pulling it out and redoing the first stripe, but decided it would be more in the spirit of the thing to leave it. </div><div><img src="Learning%20to%20Embroider%3A%20Mistakes%20are%20Anticipated.html.resources/IMG_0454.jpg" height="4032" width="3024"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>This is the moment when I felt like I got how the coral stitch worked enough to do it repeatably</div><div><img src="Learning%20to%20Embroider%3A%20Mistakes%20are%20Anticipated.html.resources/IMG_0455.jpg" height="4032" width="3024"/><br/></div><div>Before this the stitches are really uneven, and not all the knots are the same style. After this I understood it. </div><div><br/></div><div>Algerian eyes and herringbone went relatively smoothly! It’s so noticeable how much easier it feels when it’s, well, easy. </div><div><br/></div><div><img src="Learning%20to%20Embroider%3A%20Mistakes%20are%20Anticipated.html.resources/IMG_0464.jpg" height="4032" width="3024"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Getting ready for satin stitch I paused to consider whether to look up directions or guess. Seems like with directions I’m likely to get a better result, but some part of itches to just do it. I’m going to go with directions, because that seems like what a person who wasn’t rushing and was trying to understand deeply would do. Of course, when I looked it up it was exactly as simple as I predicted. </div><div><br/></div><div><img src="Learning%20to%20Embroider%3A%20Mistakes%20are%20Anticipated.html.resources/IMG_0465.PNG" height="1334" width="750"/><br/></div><div>I told myself I was just going to do enough of this to learn each stitch and see how it looks. But, now I see that I really don’t want to leave part of the section unfinished. It’s slightly painful to think of just moving on as is, but completing it when I’ve clearly learned the stitch seems to defeat the purpose. I think I might compromise by trying to do one more circle in a way that helps it feel more composed. </div><div><br/></div><div><img src="Learning%20to%20Embroider%3A%20Mistakes%20are%20Anticipated.html.resources/IMG_0467.jpg" height="4032" width="3024"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Sitting here, at work, learning to embroider and listening to music, Rosalie brings me a hot chocolate. I can’t exaplain it, but this moment overcomes me with a gratitude so warm and tender I nearly cry. How can anything be as perfect as this life I find myself living? </div><div> </div><div>A mistake! I can’t figure out how this stitch is different, except it clearly is. </div><div><br/></div><div><img src="Learning%20to%20Embroider%3A%20Mistakes%20are%20Anticipated.html.resources/IMG_0470.jpg" height="4032" width="3024"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Daisy chain is hard! That doesn’t look like a daisy at all! </div><div><img src="Learning%20to%20Embroider%3A%20Mistakes%20are%20Anticipated.html.resources/IMG_0472.jpg" height="4032" width="3024"/><br/></div><div><img src="Learning%20to%20Embroider%3A%20Mistakes%20are%20Anticipated.html.resources/IMG_0471.jpg" height="4032" width="3024"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Working on the French knots I kept running into difficulty in the same way. The thread snags up and knots too soon, then can’t pull through. Annoyingly, the very last one I did was the most messed up. It’s a hard decision whether to take it out or fix it. </div><div><br/></div><div>I’m deciding to fix it because I am super annoyed by it, and it should be an easy thing to just pull out. Even though this sample doesn’t matter at all it’s really hard for me to leave a mistake that eye catching. </div><div><br/></div><div>And, because <a dir="ltr">10pm</a> is too late to learn anything new, and this chain stitch looks like crap, I’m going to bed. </div><div><img src="Learning%20to%20Embroider%3A%20Mistakes%20are%20Anticipated.html.resources/Evernote%20Snapshot%2020181130%20215206.jpg" height="2912" width="2184"/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Timing really is everything! I came back to this at a more reasonable time, and it was immediately obvious to me how the stitch works. It took 30 seconds to get my head around it and get a good row of stitches going. </div><div><br/></div><div>Once I had the hang of chain stitch I decided to declare the sampler finished enough. My goal was to get exposed to a bunch of options for stitches, and I did. </div><div><br/></div><div>Finished enough:</div><div><img src="Learning%20to%20Embroider%3A%20Mistakes%20are%20Anticipated.html.resources/IMG_0477.jpg" height="3024" width="3024"/></div><div><br/></div><div>While in general I like the idea of learning through the projects I do, sometimes screwing up something I care about because I don’t know what I’m doing sucks. It was nice to take this on just to learn, and not to have to care about mistakes at all. When I design embroidery projects in the future I think I’ll feel more confident because I took the time to try out the skills on a throwaway project first. </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
